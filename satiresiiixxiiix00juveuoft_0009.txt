PREFACE.

Tm: Editor of the present work deems no apology necessary for sending
it before the public, being well aware, both from his own experience as
a teacher, and from hearing the sentiments of those who are still better
qualified to judge, that such a work is a desideratum in our schools.
He has spared no pains in the endeavour to bring up the notes to a
level with the present advanced stage of classical learning; and however
inconsiderable in size the book may be, the annotations have eost no
little labour. He trusts that the prize-man of the University also will
find in the discourse on Roman Satire and in the other introductory
matter, as much information upon the subject, as will save him from
that loss of time which the study of Ruperti’s Latin treatise would
occasion. He has incorporated with the notes all that is valuable in
the work of that celebrated commentator, besides much which he gleaned

from other writers.

The Editor thinks it fair to acknowledge that much of the information
contained in the notes, respecting ancient usages and customs, has been
taken from “ Smith’s Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities,’'
a work of great erudition and industry. He has also availed himself
of the assistance of “ Anthon’s edition of Lempriere‘s Classical Dic·

tionary‚’' in illustrating and explaining doubtful points of Mythology.
