186. Ille, dvc. “ One [patron, or rich man] gets the beard of a favour—
ite [slave‚ or minion] shaved, another gets lais favourite’s hair cut.'' Lu-
binus and Prateus rather carelessly make ille and hio refer to clients.
Among the wealthier Romans, the day 011 which the first beard or down
(ἰαηᾶρο) of their sons was shaved‚ and on which their hair (crinis,
cirrus, μαλλδς) was first cut, was kept as a day of rejoicing. They used
to dedicate both to some deity, as ἀναθήματα (hence some take deponere
in the present passage to signify “ offers up,'’ like ἀνατιθέναι). 011 the
same day the clients sent cakes (liba) and other presents. We here
see that the very minions of the patron were treated with the same dis-
tinction. Ruperti thinks that amatus would be the better reading, as
it would signify that several favourites in one house had to be com-ted
by the clients.

187. Libis. The libum was composed of flour, milk, eggs and oil.
The word is from the same root as our word loaf, scil. the Anglo-Saxon
hlaf.— Venalibus. The cakes were sent in such quantities that the slaves
sold them—Accipe et istud Fermentum tibi habe. “ Listen to this,
and take it with you as a provocative to wrath.’' Fer-mentum, lit.
·‘ leaven‚’' here transferred to affections of the mind.

189. Cultis athere peculia servis. ‘⁶ To increase the private property”
or “ perquisites of menials.’'—Cultis‚ equivalent to amatis, 186 ; some
render it “ pampered,'’ “ spruce.”

190. Quis time, vc. Here another reason is assigned for leaving
Rome, namely the insecurity of life from frequent house-falls.—Proeneste
is from the nomin. femin„ Praenestis. In Horace and Virgil it is neuter:
the former gives it the epithet friyidum, Od. 3. 4. 22 3 the latter calls
it alcum, AEn. 7. 682. It was a city of Latium, situated on a hill (hence
ydida) not far from Rome, and was famous for a temple of Fortune.
The city is now known by the name of Palestrina, but it is situated
lower down than the ancient Praeneste. Telegonus, son of Ulysses and
Circe, is said to have been the founder.

191. Positis, dcc. “ situated amid the wood-orowned heights.''—Ne-
morosa, ὑλήεντα, Hom.—- Volsinii, a town of Etruria, hod. Bolsena.

192. Gabii, a town of Latium, between Rome and Praeneste, termed
here Simplex i. e. “ simple,'' “ unsuspecting,'’ “ unsophisticated,’' be·
cause they had the folly to submit themselves to the authority of Sextus
Tarquinius, who eventually betrayed them. The old scholiast explains
it by‘ (ξΙαίῃἙ “.’11113,(101·110(1 '—Proni Tiburis arce‘ ‘on Tibur' s sloping
height.” Tibur, now called T'iv oli, a town of Latium, is called supinum
by Horace, Od. 3. 4. 23. as being situated on the side of a hill Arm,
like the Greek' ἄκροι and'¹ ακςον, was employed by the poets particularly
to denote ‘⁴ anything high,’' and therefore “ a hill,” or “ mountain,'’ or
“ the summit of a mountain, ·'’ it then came to signify ‘⁶ that which was
situated on an elevated place, especially, “a citadel,'’ or “ f01·tress‚’'
ἀκρόπολις, and hence“ a city.

193. Tenui tibicine fultam ‘mayna parte sui, ‘A considerable portion
of which leans upon a slender prop. ”—Tibicen, when it signifies “a
prop,’' derives this meaning from the notion of persons singing to a
flate accompaniment, for as the flate-players sustain the singers, so the
props support the (roofs of) houses; Festus. This explanation, though
evidently absurd, has not been cancelled by succeeding critics.

194. Nam sic, dac. “ For it is in this careless manner that the AEdile
keeps the houses from falling, and when he has plastered over an old
