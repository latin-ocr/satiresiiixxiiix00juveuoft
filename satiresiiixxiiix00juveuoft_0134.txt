making his way into Etruria over the Appennines.

159. Exitus erqo quis est? “ Well what is the conclusion of Hanni-
bal’s glory and of his life.''-—O yloria! This exclamation is here ex-
pressive os contempt; qu. dic. how empty and deeeitsul is fame; and
1110 evident consequence οἰ 11113 13, that a thirst for it is foolish and
wrong, which is what the poet is endeavouring to prove.

160. In exsilium proeceps fuyit, “ has to fiee into exile with all speed,”
exsilium Greek φυγή, difiered from releyatio, in that the former included
aquae et iynis interdictio, which being a citizen’s rights (caput) were
taken from him; the latter was merely banishment without the loss of
caput.—-Deportatio, is banishment to some particular spot, at a great
distance from Rome, generally some desert and wild island, such as
Gyara, Amorqus, Seriphus, dic. In this was included the total loss of
all civil privileges, the individual in fact being politically dead. Rele-
9atio was by no means so severe, certain rights, and a portion of the cri-
minal’s property were retained, and frequently a restoration to the position
nearly of an incolumis took place ; aperson could be releyatus, when placed
beyond the Tiber.—E.v silium, in its strictly legal sense was first mado
a Roman punishment, A.n.c. 688, by the Lex Calpurnia de ambitu.—
Hannibal fied first to Antiochus king of Syria, and afterwards to
Prusias king of Bithynia—Atque ibi maynus, άο. ¹‘ And there he sits

said to contain the same element as cluere (κλύω) “to hear'’ or '⁸ obey,”
and is compared by Niebuhr with the German hoeriyer, “ a dependent.''
In the Greek writers on Roman history, cliens is represented by ero-aiens
and patronus by quadrua—Remis, scil. Prusias.

164. Sed ille Cannarum vindex—annulus, “but that famous ring.
the avenger of Cannae.'’ We are, however, inclined to think that the
figure hendiadys may with propriety be adopted in line 165, “ the ring
which gave retributive vengeance for Cannae's monstrous slaughter.”-—
The battle of Cannae was fought May 21, n. c. 216. The Roman consuls
were AEmilius and Varro: the Carthaginian generals were Hannibal, Has-
drubal, and Hanno. It is probable that there is an allusion to the
rings which Hannibal sent to Carthage after the battle, and which 110
bad taken from the fingers of the Roman knights who were slain.
Hannibal destroyed himself by poison which he kept in his ring. He
did so 1ο avoid being delivered into the power of the Romans, who had
sent Q. Flaminius to Prusias to demand his person.

his crossing 1110 Alps at all.
