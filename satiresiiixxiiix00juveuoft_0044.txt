xxxvi REMARKS on THE erLEs or

with tropes, artificial, impetuous, minute, jejune, short, sometimes harah,
and often obscure. J uvenal’s is learned, strong, full, varied according
to the diversity of subject,—and hence it is at one time lively; at another,
grave3 at one time, sublime; at another, less lofty‚—but never low.
Horace' verses seem to have been written without study or art ; those
of Persius and Juvenal are far more carefully polished; ‘and they are, in
consequence, more harmonious and elegant.

The characteristics of Horace are graceful humour [urbanitas]‚ and
sprightly ridicule; of Persius, stoical gravity; of Juvenal, the harsh-
ness and sarcasm of Archilochus. Persius, who, from his natural bent
and his education, was formed only for rigid seriousness‚ never indulges
in the laugh of ridicule ; but either employs himself in scoIding, or in
mixing up jests, though he calls himself ‘⁴ petulanti splene mmmmd’
(Sat. 1. 12), and appears to have aimed at tempering the violence and
uncouth harshness of Lucilius’ style, with Horace‘ winning elegance and
softness. Juvenal's raillery is no less humorous and sprightly than
that of Horace; and sometimes he even scatters this over an entire
production, as in Sat. 4; but it is, in general, either bitter and virulent,
fitted to excite the laugh of scorn, not of ridicule [cachinnum non risum],
or else it is indecent. His agreeable witticisms are levelled either at
the ridiculous opinions of the vulgar on religion and the nature of the
gods, or at the poetic fables,—which he takes every opportunity to
deride. Compare Sat. l. 81 seq. ; 2. 31, and 130 seq. ς 4. 34 seq. ;
10. 246, and 314; 13. 34 scq.; 76. seq.; 112 seq ; 14. 261.

The Satires of Horace and Juvenal breathe that true spirit of genius
which not only gives birth to something original and makes the inventions
of others its own, but which also refines and adorns what is rude, and
brings to pei-fection that which was but begun by 0111003. Of both these
qualities Persius was almost destitute ; he takes many things from
Horace, and gives them in the same shape as he received them ς and,
doubtless, had the writings of Cornutus and the other Stoics come down
to us, we would find many of their thoughts in Persius’ compositions.

In delivering his sentiments Horace deals his advice in a sprightly,
intelligent, and friendly way; Persius philosophizes with subtilty, dimi-
nishing osten, however, the weight of his subject by the minuteness of
his remarks; Juvenal either tries to dissuade with grave emphasis, or
gives vent to considerable virulence and harshness ; but sometimes he
betrays a vain desiro of displaying his skill and learning. and grows
srigid by his efforts to be ssowery, and by his pursuing the subtilties ot*
the Rhetorician. This, it is but just to state, was highly admired by
Scaliger.
