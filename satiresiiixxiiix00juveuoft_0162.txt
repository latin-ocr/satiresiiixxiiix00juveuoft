Strymo, a river of Thrace.—Nubem sonoram, “the noisy multitude,”
like νέφος.

168. Pyymoeus. The qumaei were a nation of dwarfs, according to
Pliny, in the extreme parts of India; according to Homer, Mela, and
Strabo, in AEthiopia ; and according to others, in Scythia. They went
mounted on goats and lambs, of proportionable stature, to make waragainst
the cranes, which, at the approach of winter in Thrace, used to fly to the
more genial climate of the Pygmaeans. The fable of their small stature
is thought to have arisen from the etymology of the word, scil. πυγμὴ
or πυγὰν, which means cubitus, a length of eighteen inches. Achaintoe
considers that the fable was owing to the exaggerated accounts of travel-
lers, who, being in the part of Scythia. that adjoined Laponia, and having
seen one or two of the Lapones, represented them vo have been much
shorter than they really were; their height being four feet in general.
A1·1stotle locates the Pygmies on the banks of the Nile, and as the
cranes make their appearance there about the month of November, the
time at which the waters subside, and devour the corn sown on the
lands, the whole fable may be explained by supposing them to have
been none other than the Egyptians, and the term Piymy not to refer
to any diminutiveness of size, but to the πήχεις, or cubus of the Nile's
rise.—-Parvis, ‘⁴ diminutive.'’

169. Impar, “ an unequal match for.”

171. Quaticire, “ you would be convulsed.”

172. Quamquam. This word is totally out of place here, as it actu-
ally, if translated, gives a meaning to the clause contrary to that which
must undoubtedly be taken. Juvenal say& that one would laugh
heartily if he saw at Rome a conflict of such diminutive warriors as the
Pygmies; but that among the latter (illic) no one would laugh, Bnemsr.
the frequency of such sights would remove in time every perception of
the ludicrous. Tbereforc quoniam is better suited to the clause than
quamquam, but it would not suit the metre. Jacobs conjectures
quando, for quandoquidem. Perhaps, however, the whole line is
spurious.”

174. Nullane, dvc. “ So, then, (says Calvinus) will no punishment
attend a perjured individuaL and a fraud so iniquitous?'' Granting,
then, that I am not to be astonished at the treachery I have met with.

trumo, dcc. It is better to assign these words to Calvinus, “yet the
least drop of blood from his mangled fraino will afford me enviable
satisfaction ; ycs, revengc is a blessing dcarer than lise itscls.'’ Others
assign the words to Juvenal, and t1·anslatc—·‘ will afford you a satias-w-
tion that will bring odium upon you.’' We can scarcely see how this
