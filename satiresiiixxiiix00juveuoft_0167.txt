NOTES ΟΝ SATIRE XIV.

ARGmn-:xr

'1⁸11ss subjects of this Satire are of the most important kind, and the
poet, as if fully aware of it, has treated them in his best manner. In
none of his works does he take a loftier flight, in none is he more vigor-
ous and energetic, in none more clear and precise in his style, more
original in his conceptions, more happy in his illustrations, or more
powerful and commanding in his general deductions.

'Phe whole is directed to the one great end of sels-improvement. By
showing the dreadful facility with which children copy the vices of their
parents, 1 seqq. 31 seqq. he points out the necessity, as well as the sacred
duty, of giving them examples of domestic purity and n‘rtue, 38—-85,

After briefly enumerating the several vices of gaming, 4 seqq. glut·
tony, 6—14; cruelty, 15—25; debauchery‚ 23—-30‚ sko. 86 seqq. which
youth imperceptibly imbibe from their elders, 31 seqq. he enters more
at large into that of avarice; of which he shows the fatal and inevitable
consequences, 107 seqq.

Nothing can surpass the exquisiteness of this division of the Satire‚
in which he traces the progress of that passion in the youthful mind,
from the paltry tric-ks of saving a broken meal, 126—137. to the daring
violation of every principle human and divine, 215—255.

Having placed the absurdity, as well as the perplexity and danger,
of immoderate desires in every possible point of view, 256—314. the
piece concludes with a solemn admonition to be satisfied with those
comforts and conveniences which nature and wisdom require, and which
a decent competence is easily calculated to supply, 315—326. Beyond
this, desire is infinite: a gulf which nothing can fill, an ocean without
soundings and without shores! ‹vr—331.

With the latter part of this Satire, compare Horace, Sat. 1. 1 ; and
Sat. 2. 3. 108, seqq. with the former, Seneca de Ira, 2. 22, and Ep. 97.

 

1. Plurima sunt, ἀο. “Very many crimes there are, Fuscum, which
both merit unfavourable report, and which imprint a stain that will ever
adhere to objecta otherwise of attractive elegance.'’ ΠἹ10 Fuscinus
was, is not known—Et nitidis, dcc. A metaphor taken from white and
clean garments being sullied; so those acts, which are worthy of 11111111·-
ourable repert, infix a. stain on the most splendid character, rank, and
fortune. For maculam hoesuram some MSS. have maculam et ruqam,
others, maculam ac ruqam, some also between lines 1. 2. supply a
verse—Et quid majorum vitio sequiturque minores, which probably
formed part of a metrical argument. to the satire.

3. Momm-ant traduntque, “show and transmit,'’ show by their ex·
ample, and transmit by their precepts.
