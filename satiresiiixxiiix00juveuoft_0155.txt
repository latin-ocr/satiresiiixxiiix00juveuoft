SATIRE xm. 109

word, however, is undoubtedly German.—Cirrlaaei, Apollo was wor-
shipped at Cirrha, inPhocis, near the foot of Parnassus, and not far
from Delphi, of which it was the port. Hence he is called Delius
Vates, Virg.—- Vates is the Greek μάν-τις.

80. Per calamos, ἁο. “ by the arrows and the quiver of the huntress—
maiden‚'’ scil. Diana, ''Aqoeepzw ἄγξω-ἕξοι.

81. AEqoei, “ of the AEgean sea,” (maris). Neptune's chief residence
was in the AEgean, which was so named after AEycus, king of Athens,
(the father of Theseus) who drowned himself therein. Others derive
the epithet from AEyae, a town of Euboea 3 others from the number of
islands which it contains, and which appear above the sea as αἶγες,
“ goats ;’' others from AEgea, a queen of the Amazons. The modern
name of this sea is Archipelago, which is a modern Greek word. There
is some doubt whether the original modern term was Egio Pelago (a
corruption of AEyeum pelayzcs), or Agio Pelago (from the sanctity οῖ’
the monasteries on Mount Athos, and in the island). It is well known
that the vulgar derivation, ἀρχὴ and πέλαγος is completely erroneous.—
Tridenlem. The trident was an attribute of Nereus as well as Neptune,
(Virg. AEn. 2. 418); also of the Tritons. It was originally a “three-
pronged’' 90αά (hence stimulus is understood to it), used to incite
horses to greater swiftness. Neptune was supposed to be armed with
it when he drove his chariot, and it thus became his usual attribute,
perhaps with an allusion also to the use of the same instrument in
harpooning fish; whence it is called ἰχθυβόλος μηχάνη, AEsch. s. c. Τ.

82. Herculis Arcus, ‘¹ Hercules‘ bow and arrows'' dipped in the
blood of the Lernaean Hydra, without which, the Fates had decreed,
Troy could not be captured. Hercules bequeathed them to Philocte-
tes—Minerva was called Pallas either from “brandishing'' (πάλλειν)
the spear, or from having slain the giant Pallas.

83. Quidquid, dxc. “ And all the weapons which the arsenals ot
heaven contain.”

84. Comedam, ὥσ. “may 1 eat, he says, the lamented head of my
son, boiled and soused in the vinegar of Egypt,'’ if Ι speak falsely,
—equivalent to saying, “may I be a second Thyestes.”—-Sinciput is
here used for the whole head, although properly it is half of the head
(qu. semicaput), or perhaps “ the forehead.’'—Phario. Pharos was a little
island of Egypt, close to Alexandria, now united to the continent by
alluvial deposit; but the name is often employed to signify the whole
country. Egyptian vinegar, as it appears from several passageS, was
in high estimation.

86-119. The poet now tells us why it is that numbers do not hesi-
tate to commit perjury.—- Sunt in Fortzmce, “ some there are who rank
all things among the chauces of fortune, viz. the Epicureans.

87. BIoveri, ‘⁴ is governed.”

88. Natura volvente vices. ¹‘ Nature rolling on the changes‚” “di-
recting the vicissitudes.’‘

89. Altaria tanqum. Persons touched the altars when praying and
swearing. Those who believed in the existence of no deity, and those
who, like the Epicureans, thought that they took no interest in human
affairs, could not feel any terror (intrepidi) in committing pe1·jury; but
(90, 90) there is another class of persons who do believe, both in the
existence of the gods, and also in their providence, but who perjure
themselves likewise, laying at the same time ‘¹ a flattering unction to
their souls, (92, ἀπο.)

91. Ita (loquitur) secum, “thus soliloquizes.'’
