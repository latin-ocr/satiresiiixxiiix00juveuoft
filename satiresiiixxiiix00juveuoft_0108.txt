longs to that mud-eddying stream, nor has he the obolus in his mouth
to present.'’ Tetrum porthmea, στυγνὸν mesaia, Theocrit. Porthmea

his being so crushed by the prostrate vehiele as to have πο mouth to re-
ceive the fare for the boat.—-Porri9at, scil. to Charon.-— T rientem, the
triens was properly “ the third of an As‚” here it is used for obolus. It
was customary for the Greeks and Romans to put an obolus into the
mouth of a dead friend, as a fare for Charon, ναῦλον, or ναῦλος; τὰ
