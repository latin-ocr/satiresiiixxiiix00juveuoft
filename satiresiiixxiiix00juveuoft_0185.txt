SATIRE xiv. 139

poscentibus could have arisen only from a gloss explaining repetentibus.
Carrio first restored the present lection, who informs us, on the autho-
rity of Nonius, that assa meant ‘⁸ a nurse,” “ quod semper Ansu· (i. e.
adsit i1's quos nutriat.'' But the Old Scholiast more correctly explains
it to mean ·‘ nutria- sicca (sole colorata, ruyosa) σε vetusta, quoe lac non
proestat infantibus, sed solam diliyentz'am et munditiam adlzibet.” Thc
word therefore is properly the feminine of assus, ¹* dry‚'’ “ roasted,'’ “ broil-
ed,” which is qu. ‹zi-sus, from ardeo, arsum, or from ἆζω, ·“ει”σοο,”-Ηε-
pentibus, repere and serpere came both from ἰ’ριτω, but their significa-
tion became quite distinct; repo, ⁴‘ to creep‚⁷’ is said properly of animals
with short legs; serpo, ¹⁸ to crawl‚” of reptiles which go upon the belly.

209. Ante alpha et beta, ‘⁴ before their A B C.''

210. Talibus instantem monitis, “ when earnestly instilling such
advice.''

211. «Dic, dm. What is the use of all this hurty? Avarice w1ll
show itself quite soon enough in your son, without, your endeavours
to imbue him therewith so early.

212. Meliorem, (bc. “ I wari-ant the pupil to be a greater proficient
than his master,’¹ κρείττονα διδασκάλου μαθητήν.-][α9ἰείνο, scil. te.

213. Securus abi. “ Go away without any fear.”— VincErz's, your son
will surpass you in this vice, as Ajax and Achilles surpassed their re-
spective fathers in heroic achievements.

214. Praeteriit, ¹‘ out-stript.’'—- Vicit “ out-did,” “ surpassed.''--
Achilles. It, was predicted that the son of Thetis should be greater
than his father, which was the reason that Jupiter, who had fallen in
love with the goddess, forbore to press his suit; and it. was conse-
queutly arranged that she should marry a mortal.

215. Parcendum (est tibi) teneris, dte. “ You must be easy with those
of tender years: the vices which characterise mature depravity have
not yet gained occupation of their hearts ;’' i. e. you must excuse your
children if they are not, your equals in wickedness; wait until they have
grown up, and you will see that their villany has increased with their
years—Medulla is properly “the marrOW,” from Greek μύελας, μευλλος
= nantinus, hence figurate “the inmost. part, of any-thing? and su,
‘¹ the heart,¹' ‘¹ feelings,” &e.—Macurae, other editions read nativae.
“ which is born with then1.’'

217. Lonyi blateronem admittere cultri, “to apply the edge of the
razor to his chin ς i. e. when he shall be grown up. Culter from cello,
(percello ‚· English coultem· in southern Germany das kolter; French
comeam Greek μάχαιρα, ants, or σφαγίς) was a knife with only one
edge, which formed a straight line. It, was used for a variety of pur-
poses 3 but chiefly for killing animals either in the slaughter-house, or
in huntfflg, or at the altars of the gods. The name culter was also
applied to razors, but it certainly in this case was different from
those employed sor the above purposes, for whenever it was used for
shaving it was generally distinguished from the common culter by some
epithet, as culter tonsorious. Some maintain that. it properly signified
“the coulter of a plough,” and is deduced from colo, as rascer [ras-
trum] from rado.

218. Vendet, dec. He will perjure himself for the most trifling eonsi-
deration.

219. Cereris. Ceres was regarded as one of the most sacred deities.
—Aram‚ see note on 3. 145.

220. Elatum jam crede nurum. ‘¹ Just believe your son's wife already
dead and buried.’' Your son will arrive at such a piteh of wickedness,
