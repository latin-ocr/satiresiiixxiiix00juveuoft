upon them (perone setoso), bound about the ankles‚ the knees ami
calves of the legs being entirely bare.——Submovet, “ keeps out.''
a nit-

ξ187. Pellibus inversis, “ with the hair innermost.’' Facciol.—Pere-
yrina iynotaque nobis, dxc. “ Purple ;—whatever that is,—some foreign
importation (or “ an exotio ’'), with which we are unacquainted‚ leads
to crime and sin.'' Others read Quodcunque est, scil. nefas, “leucis
to the commission of crime of every description.

189. Hoec precepta. “ Such lessons as these.'’— Veteres, scil. dabant
or dare solebant.

190. Post finem Auctumni. When the winter set in, the Romans
began their morning studies by lamp-light.—Medi‹i de nocte *⁵ Ar
midnight‚” ‘¹' as soon as it is midnight,⁷’ the force of the preposition is
“ raon the commencement of midnight.'’ Thus, in “ szcryzmc de nocte
latrones’' (Hor.) it means “as soon as night sets in.'’—-Supinum.
“ lying in bed‚” understand in lecto : the word properly means “ lying
on his back,’' equiv. to the Greek ὕπτιος, to which is opposed nemis.

191. Clamfisus. “ With vociferous ea11.’'—Accz·pe ceras, “ take your
wax-tablets.”

192. Viqila. “ Watch, awake‚'' “ sit up at your studies.’'—Pcrleqe.
Avo„ ¹⁴ read closely the red-titled (or ‘⁸ 1¹ubric'’) laws of our ancestors.‘'
The Romans wrote the titles and beginnings both of their books of
law, and books generally, with reddle, or red chalk, called μίλτος by the
Greeks, and rubrica by the Latius (not minium, as some suppose). Tne
term ‘⁵ rubric'’ is still applied to the directions inserted in our Liturgy,
although they are printed no longer in red letter, but in Italics.

193. Vitem posce libello, ‘⁴ memorial for the post of centurion.'’
The Vitis was the badge of office (scil. a. rod), with which the cen-
turion punished his men. Spelman, in a note on the Anabasis of
Xenophon, states that the Greeks used the σκῆπτρον to chastise the
soldiers, like the vilis. This last word is used in the present passage
iu the sense of a “ centurion’s office.”

194. Sed caput, abc. Seqq. But show yourself with unpolished ex-
terior, and negligent in respect os adorning your person, that the general
may consider you adapted for the rugged duties of a soldier’s life.—
Buxo. ‘⁴ by a comb,'¹ which was generally made of “ box-wood.'' For
sed caput in this line Schurzfleisch. approves of sit caput being substi-
tuted ; sed, in his opinion, destroying the sense of the passage.

195. Grandes alas, “your huge shoulders.'’ Britannicus explains
“your arm-pits bushy with strong hair.'' Casaubon seems to take the
same meaning, as he makes the words equivalent to μασχάλαις δασείας
in Theophrastus ; on which he remarks that numbers of the Athenians,
in order to be thought strong men, and remote altogether from effemi-
nacy, strove to become hairy in the arm—pits. For that, when they
came into the public assembly‚ they stripped that part of their frame
when votiug, that all might see it when they upraised their arm.
‘¹ Hairy nostrils'' also were significant of manliness, for the effeminate
used to pluck out the superfluous hairs.-Loelius, i. e. “ your general.'’

196. Dirae Maurorum atteyias. “ Demolish the cots of the Numi-
dians,” the atteyioe were cottages (mayaria) placed on wheels. The
word comes from ad-teyo, as καλύβη from ‚camdenum—The Brigantes
were a people of Britain, whose capital was York.

197. Locupletem aquilam. ‘⁴ A lucrative centurionship.” The aquila
was the standard of a legion, and is here taken for the legion itself.—
Sexaqesimus annus. They rose, step by step, through the ten cohorts.
