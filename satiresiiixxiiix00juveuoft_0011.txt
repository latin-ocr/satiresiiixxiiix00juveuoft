LIFE OF JUVENAL.

[FROM GIFFORD]

Dncnms J [εκ-ωε J cvaxAns was born in the reign of Caligula, about the
year of our Lord 385ὶιι at AquInum a town of the Volsci ; which in the
thirteenth century gave a name to another illustrious native, Thomas
Aquinas, distinguished among the schoohnen by the title of “ The An-
gelic Doctor.'’ Of J uvenal's life but little can be collected; and of this
little, much is built upon uncertainties. From pride or modesty, he has
left but few notices of himself. As to his circumstances, indeed, he
gives us to understand that he had a competence : the little patrimony
which his father (or foster-father} left him, he never diminished, and
probably never increased: it seems to have equalled all his wants.
The earliest account extant of him (which is commonly, and by Sal-
masius amongst others, attributed to Suetonius) has few marks of being
written by a contemporary, and is very concise and meagre. He is
said to have been either the son, or the foster-son, of a wealthy freed-
man, who gave him a liberal education. Till the age of forty (about
78, A. n.) he continued to prosecute the study of eloquence‚ by declaim—

than from any intention to prepare himself either for the schools or for
the courts of law. That system of favouritism, which under Claudius
had nearly ruined the empire‚ Domitian, in the early part of his reign,
show-ed symptoms of reviving, by his unbounded partiality towards a
young pantomimis> dancer of' the name of Paris. Against this minion
Juvenal seems to have directed almost the first shasts of that Satire,
which was destined, in after years, to make the most powerful vices
*ti-emble. He composed a few lines on the influence of Paris, with con-
siderable success, which encouraged him to cultivate this kind of poetry;
he had, however, the prudence not to commit himself to an auditory, in
a reign which swarmed with informers, and only circulated his composi-
tions privately among his friends. By degi-ees he grew bolder; and
having made many large additions to his first sketch, if not recast it,
produced what is now called Satire 7th, which he recited to a numerous
assemblage about 83, Λα). Paris is said to have been informed of his
own introduction into the piece, and to have taken such umbrage, as to
[ay a formal complaint of it before the emperor. If, owing to this
