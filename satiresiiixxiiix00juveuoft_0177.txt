be accorded to Juvenal, who, from his ancestral prejudices, view-ed the
Jews with a very unfavourable eye.

96. Quidam, (hc. ‘¹ Some who happen to havea father superstiti-
ously observant of the Sabbath‚ worsth nothing but the clouds and the
sky as a divinity.” ’ As the Jews used to utter their prayers under
the open air (their temple had no roos), and directed their looks
upward, the Romans imagined that they worshipped the clouds and
the “material heaveff' (numen eceli). They had no images like the
Romans to which they might kneel. Some edd. read coeli lumen.

98. On account of the Jews’ abstaining from ⁶· swine’s flesh‚'’ Juvenal
here humourously says that they esteemed it as of equal value with that
of a human being.

100. Leyes. ⁸· Statutes.''

101. Judaicum, ἀρ. “ They learn thoroughly‚ observe, and reverence
the Jewish system of law, “ all that Moses transmitted to posterity in
his mystic volume, (the Pentateuch).‘’ A copy of the Pentateuch was
kept (as it is to this day) in every synagogae, locked up in a press or
chest (arca, hence arcuna), and never exposed to sight, unless when
brought out to be read at the time of worship: at the conclusion of the
service it was returned to its place and again locked up.

103. Mons-erare, i. e. monstrare solenh the historical infinitivo.—
Eadem nisi sacra colenti, “unless to one who observed the same form
of worship‚‘' as themselves. The Jewish law inculcated no such inhu-
manity: Juvenal was decidedly ignorant both of the laws and practices
of the Jews.

104. Quoesitum adsontem, dxc. “ To conduct only the circumcised to
a wished-for spring:” well might the poet say, ‘⁶ the wished-sor spring‚''
as J udea is but poor-ly supplied with water.-— Vezpus is the same with
apella (Hor.) and recutitus (Pers.)

105. Sed pater, dte. ‘⁶ But the father is to blame, by whom every
seventh day was devoted to idleness, and had no concern with any por-
tion οἱ the duties of life;'’ or, we may construet et (qui, scil. paler)
non αἰτίφίτ, (ke. The Jews certainly carried their reverence for the
Sabbath to an extreme, as they condemned even works of necessity and
mercy to be done then, see John, vii. 23. They likewise forbade
sels-defenee on the Sabbath.

107. Spoute, (rc. Juvenal now proceeds to show how avarice is com-
municated from father to son, but he makes a distinction between it and
other vices. For youths fall into other vices with ease, but avarice
goes against their natural feelings.—Cetera, scil. vitia pareutum.

108. Inviti quoque exercere, ‘⁵ to practice even against their inclina-
tions.'’-—E.z·ercere, ιὶσκειι. Horace says that a youth is naturally ⁴⁴ pro-
diqus aeris.‘’ (Ars. poet.)

109. Fallit, ὣς. “ For this vice (avarice) deceives under the mask
and semblance of virtue, since it is grave in demeanom, and rigid in

· look and attire. The virtus which avarice seems to have is economy.

The mind of youth may be misled by the forbidding aspect of avarice
(110), so as to imagine it to be a virtuous pursuit; for vice, in order to
attract, is decked out with objects of allurement.

112. Tamquam. dvc. ‘⁵ As an economist, and protector of his effects‚

more to be relied on than,’' (tc.
114. Hesperidum. The Hesperides were three celebrated nymphs,

daughters of Hesperus. They were appointed to guard the golden
apples which Juno gave to Jupiter on the day of their nuptials; and
the place of their residence, placed beyond the ocean by Hesiod, is more
