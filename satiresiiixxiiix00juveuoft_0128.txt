attends having the care of his small satchel, begins to pray for the
eloquence and reputation of Demosthenes or Cicero, and continues to
pray for the same during the entire Quinquatria.”——Demostlzenis. This ,
magnificent orator was born in the 4th year of the 98th olympiad, Rc.
385. Of his life it is superfluous here to give even an outline. Heeren
speaks of him in the following affecting terms, before he sketches his
life: “Who ever suffered more severely than he for his greatness.
Of all political characters, Demosthenes is the most sublime and tragic
character. with which history is acquainted. When still trembling
with the vehement force of his language, we read his life in Plutarch,
—when we transfer ourselves into his times and his situation, we are
carried away by a deeper interest than can be excited by any hero of
the Epic muse, or of tragedy. From his first appearance till the
moment when he swallows poison in the temple, we see him contending
against destiny. which seems to mock him with malignant cruelty.’'
He concludes a summary of the principal events in his lise by asking,
“where shall we find a character of more grandeur and purity than
that of Demosthenes ?” He poisoned himself. to avoid falling into the
hands of Antipater's minions, in the temple of Neptune in the island
Calauria, near Traezene. He was above 60 when he died—Ciceronis.
This great orator was born at Arpinum, a Latin city. ou the third of
January in the 103d year, n.c. Pompey was born on the last of
September in the same year. Arpinum was also celebrated as the
birth-place of Marius, the opponent of Sylla. Cicero was killed, mc.

who put him on his proscription list. Herennius was his assassin.
With regard to Cicero's claims as a poet, thero has been much dispute.
Juvenal had a very indifferent opinion indeed of his poetic talent (line
122); but it seems altogether unjust to condemn a poet sor a single
faulty line. [The line, ‘¹ O fortunatam witam mc consule RomamP’
appears to me to have gained most undeserved censure. I do not see
how it can bc csteeiued so faulty (in the repetition os—natam natam)
