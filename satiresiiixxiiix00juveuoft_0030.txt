not only to those compositions said to be the inventions of Ennius, but
to those of Lucilius also. And this kind of composition is not spoken
of by the Greek writers, nor its names, Satura, Satira, and Satyra;
the Romans, too, neither called their own satire Satyrica, nor were
the Satyric poems, fables, or dramas of the Greeks ever called Satirae
·or Satyrae. The Romans hardly make any mention of the Satyric
fables at least by name; nor did any of them write compositions of the
latter class (with the exception of Lucan, perhaps, to whom 14 Satyric
fables are ascribed ; of what nature, however, we cannot say;) Satyrs,
indeed, do not seem to have ever been introduced at Rome, the passage
in Horace, which is considered evidence to the contrary, (Epist. ad.
Pis. 220, 250) being explained by Ruperti as containing rules for the
Satyric fables of the Greeks, not of the Romana* Dionysius, who
refers Rome and all that belonged thereto to a Greek origin, assigns to
the same the commencement of a very ancient custom which prevailed
in triumphal processions, In these the victorious army used to banoer
their general with raillery, and Satyri attached the bystanders with v
J'ests and saucy expressions which he calls κίρτομος καὶ σατυρικὴ emma.
But this custom was not borrowed from the Greeks. It is in reality to .
be traced to the most remote ages, and to the similar solemnizations
of the old festivals before mentioned. It was nothing more than that
custom afterwards so well known, which Dionysius ascribes to a later
period only; ⁸⁶ νῦν δὲ ποιήματα ᾅδουσιν αὖτοσχὶδια;” t'. e. verses like the
Fescennine, and uncouth. Moreover, that those Satyri were only
Mimists is seen from Dionysius’ words, “oiim δέ Σάτυροι avienum-6·
τε καὶ κατεμιμοῦντο τὰς σπουδαίας κινήσεις iet) τὰ γελοιὸτεςα ‘narravique-:ff
Nor will this seem surprising when we remcmber that the words eirveus.
σισυρίζειι, and σατυρικὸς were applied to all characters and subjects of a
jocular cast, and replete with mirth not the most dignified. and that
the mimists and Pantomimists osten put on the comio masks of the
Satyrs, and represented the characters of the latter. Hence Ruperti
would be inclined to refer two passach, one of Athenaeus. and the
othei· of Marius Victorinus, to the illimes rather than to either the
Satyric or Atellan fables. Marius adduces an Iambic dimeter;

and the supposition that this line concluded a mime derives probability
from Cic. pro Coel. 27, ‘⁸ Mimi jam exitus est, non fabulae: in quo quum
