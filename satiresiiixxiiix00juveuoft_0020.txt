cus.

P. AElius Hadrianus, having been saluted as Emperor
and Augustus, by the army at Antioch‚ comes to
Rome.

It is to this period that Dodwell refers the consul-
ship of Quintilian, and the recitations of numerous
poets, among whom he places Juvenal, Compare
Sat. 1. 1, seqq. and 7 ; 188 to 198. Hadrian reigned
21 years, and from his taste for literature and his
eneouragement of men of genius, the commence-
ment of Sat. 7 has been by many referred to him.

Consuls, Quinctius Niger and Τ. Vipsanius Aproni-
anus.

above, 853) and died there in a very short time.
The place of his exile is much disputod; some
maintaining that it was SiEne [a town of Upper
Egypt]; others Pentapolis of Libya, that is Cyre·
naiea ; others Oasis or oasa a town in Libya.
Consuls, M. Annius Verus (2d timo) and L. Augur.

Ruperti) wc have adhercd to tho arrangement which Ruperti evidently
