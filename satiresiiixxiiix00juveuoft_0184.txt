138 :verns ox JUVENAL.

Achaintre, however, says that Juvenal speaks in hyperbole, sor no one
was forced to act as a soldier after his fiftieth year.

199. Et trepidum solvunt, &c. “ And the blast of the horn mingled
with the clarion’s peal act as a cathartie from terror.” More literally
“ cause your bowels to become loose through terror.”—Lituis. The word
lituus was employed by the Latin writers to denote (1) the crooked staff
borne by the augurs, with which they divided the expanse of heaven,
when viewed with reference to divination (templum), into regions (re-
yiones). (2) a sort of trumpet slightly curved at the extremity. It differ-
ed both from the tuba and the cornu, the former being straight, while the
latter was bent round into a spiral shape. Lydus calls the lituus the
sacerdotal trumpet (ἱερατικὴν σάλπιγγα), and says that it was employed
by Romulus when he proclaimed the title of his city. Acro asserts that
it was peculiar to cavalry, while the tuba belonged to infantry. Its
tones are usually characterised as harsh and shrill. Miiller supposes
the word lituus to be Etruscan, signifying “ crooked.'' The cornu was
called in Greek στρογγύλη wamy& and was curved nearly in the shape
of a C.

200. Pares, (he. “You may purchase that which you can sell at
fifty per cent profit,” literally, “ for more by a half.'’ If you don't like
war, says the father of modern days, engage in business; become a.⁴
merchant.

201. Do not disdain even the most offensive trades, provided they are

rofitable.
p 202. Αόἷεραηάω, (ke. ‘⁶ Which must be removed to the other side of
the Tiber.” 'ranning and other offensive trades were obliged to be
carried on at the further bank of the Tiber.

203. Ponendum, dcc. “ That any distinction is to be placed between
persumes and a stinking hide,’' i. e. between dealing in perfumes and
pursuing the trade of a tanner. If the latter is the more profitable
business, you should prefer it to the former, for there is no difference
between things which produce equal profit.

204. Lucri, ὥσ. This alludes to the well-known reply of Vespasian
to his son Titus, the humour of which, says Gifford, will be more ap-
preciated on the consideration of the fact that the ancients tried the
purity of their money by the smell.·—Ex re Quilibet.. ¹⁴ N o matter from
what it eomes.’'

205. Illa tao, ὥσ. “ Be that sentiment of the poet ever in your
mouth.''

200. Dis atque ipso Jove digma. This, says Ruperti, is ironical; so
says Farnabius, whose words Stocker gives without comment. But
how these commentator-³ could have formed such an opinion is rather
surprising. From the words accipe ceras (191) to the end of line 207.
the father is speaking to his son, consequently the words of 206 are
not expressive os the feelings of Juvenal, but of the speaker: and it is
but natural to conclude that, as the pater had made the sentiment unde
habeas, (hc. the maxim of his life. be thought it worthy of the highest
eulogy. Besides, the recommending of it to his son by ironica! praise
is surely proponemus-Pom, scil. Ennius, who took it from the Bel-
lerophon of Euripides.

207. Habeas, scil. ope-3. divitius, the word is used here absolutely in
the sense os '¹ to bo rieh‚'' like ἷχιιι in Greek.

208. Hoc monstrant. ὡς). “This advice old dry—nurses give their
male nurslings while they aro yet creeping.'' For repentibus (πε-τω
