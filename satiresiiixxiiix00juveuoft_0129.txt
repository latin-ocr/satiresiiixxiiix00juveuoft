entitled “ Marius'' had the fairest chance of descending to posterity.
In fact poetry and oratory demand the very same qualities—-an ardent
imagination, a fertile invention, and grandeur and elevation of style.
(Vide Anthon's introduction to his edition of Cicero's Orations.) A
desire to run down the character of a political opponent, appears to have
been the reason why the flatterers of Augustus depreciated his poetic
talent.

115. Quinquatribus. Quinquatrus—uum. or Quinquatria—ium, was
a festival sacred to Minerva, celebrated on the 19th of March, and was
so called according to Varro, because it was the fifth day after the Ides,
in the same way as the Tusculans called a festival on the sixth day after
the Ides Sexatrus, and one on the seventh Septematrus. Both Varro
and Festus state, that the Quinquatrus was celebrated for only one day,
but Ovid says, for five days, and for this reason was called by this name,
“junctis quinque diebus—nomen habet.'' That on the first day no blood
was shed, but that on the last four there were contests of gladiators. The
first day, however, was only the festival, properly, so called, and the last
four were merely an addition made, perhaps in the time of Caesar, to
gratisy the people, who became so passionately fond of gladiatorial com-
bats. Ovid says, that this festival was celebrated in commemoration of
the birth-day of Minerva; but, according to Festus, it was sacred to
Minerva, because her temple on the Aventine was consecrated on that
day. As the festival was sacred to B'Iinerva, it seems that women were
accustomed to consult fortune—tellers and diviners upon this day. Do-
mitian caused it to be celebrated every year in his Alban Villa, situated
at the foot of the hills of Alba, and instituted a collegium to superin-
tend the celebration, which consisted of the hunting of wild beasts, of
the exhibition of plays, and of contests of orators and poets. There was
another festival of this name, called Quinquatrus Mtnusculoe, or Quin-
quatrus Minores, celebrated on the Ides of June. on which the tibicines
went through the city in procession to the temple of Minerva.

116. Uno partam—asse, i. e. for which he has paid but an as,
therefore he was a mere tyro ς one of the lowest form, as we would say.
one who had got a pennyworth of learning. The schoolmaster’s see
was called Minerval, and in Greek δίδακτρον.

117. The words anquam and vernula are emphatic, showing that the
scholar was quite a child. The slaves who carried the books of a boy
to school, were called Cap-sarii, and were much beneath the Poedayoyi
in rank. The latter were tutors in Greek samilies of opulence, and
were generally singled out from the most trustworthy of the slaves.
Our word page is supposed to be a corruption of this word.

119. Luryus, ἁο. “ It was the fountain—spring of genius too wide and
over-gushing, that consigned both to destruction.''

120. Inyenio, dvc. “Genius it was that got the head and hand cut
off.'’ Ruperti tells us that inqenio is pleasantly put for Ciceroni, viro
tanti ivzyenii, i. e. the abstract for the concrete. Caius Popilius Lenas
was the commander of the party employed to assassinate Cicero. He
had been formerly saved by Cicero in an action sor life and death, and
yet he cut off the orator's head and hands, and carried them to Antony,
after which they were fixed on the Rostra, the head between the hands.
This mutilation was also inflicted upon Antonius, the grandfather of the
Triumvir, and the first of the earlier oratore.

121. Causidici-pusilli “of a shallow lawyer,'' ‘¹ a paltry pettifog-
ger.’'—Pusillus is a diminutive of pasus, “ a boy,'' from puer, or παῖς.
