according to Suidas, ssourished at Rome under Hadrian,-— Torrentior,
metaphorically, from the full and forcible waters of a rivam compare
10, 9 and 128. In the same way Homer uses ῥέει, Il. αἱ, 249. Comp-
also multo salsoque fluenti, Hor. Sat. 1, vii, 28.

74. Ede, dcc. “ Tell me what do you think the fellow is ?'' i. e. what
kind of persons do you take those Greeks to be, who now live at Rome?

75. Quem vis hominem, “ a man of all work,” “ a J ack of all trades‚”
i. e. the Greeks here profess a knowledge of everything, Grammar,
Rhetoric‚ dre.

76. Geometras (pronounced as a trisyllable by synizesis), terroe ‘men-
sor, Hor. Od. 1. 28. l—Aliptes (ἀλείπτης), either “ an anointer of
wrestlers” (fr. ἀλεὶφω uuyuo) in the gymnasium; or “ a bath-man,’'
who anointed those who had bathed ; 01· “ an oculist.'’

77. Schoenobdtes (σχοινοβάτης), funambulus, ‘⁴ a rope—dancer.’' The
art of daneing on the tight rope was carried to as great perfeetion
among the Romans, as it is with us, see Hor. Epist. 11. 1. 210. Terent.
Hec. Prol. 4. 34. A strange attempt of the emperor Galba, to exhibita v
Elephants walking on the rope, is mentioned in Pliny H. N. 2. Suet.
Galb. vi.

78. Graeculus, ἀπο. “ Why our Greekling, in want of sood will take a
fiight into the air, [as Daedalus did] should you bid him.'' The diminu-
tive expresses contempt—Esuriens, for hunger sharpens the saculties.—-
Ver-bs in—urio are called desiderative, and correspond to those with
the termination ιιω in Greek—Ibit, i. e. volabit, “will try to fly‚'' the
action itself being used for the attempt.

79—80. Ad summam “ in short‚'’ artistsr like Doedalus can only be
produced in Grecce.—Qui sumsit pennas. There is here a double
allusion ; (1) to Daedalus ; (2) to an individual at Rome who made an
attempt to fly in the reign of Nero, but sailed. Howevcr, there is no
certainty that the latter was an Athenian.—Mediis sed natus Athenis,
“born even in Athens ;'’ medius does not always mean the middle

recisel .
p 81. lylorum eqo uon suyiam, &c—Shall 1 not, says Umbricius, fly
from this city, where 1 cannot without indignation witness those Greeks
attain to the highest station in wealth and importance 2—C'onchylia,
the conchylium (κογχύλιον) was properly the shell-fish or unu-ex from
which the purple dye was obtained ; here it is put sor “ the purple robes‚”
