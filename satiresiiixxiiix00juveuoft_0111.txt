SATIRE 111. 65

from Ostia, and carry it through the marshes to Terracina, but the
plan perished with him, and gave way to the more moderate, but prac—
ticable one of Augustus, who endeavoured to carry off the superfluous
waters by opening a canal all along the Via Appia, from Forum Appii
to the grove of Feronia. This canai still remains, cavata. The marshes
were neglected after the time of AugustuS‚ until the reigns of Nerva and
Trajan, the latter of whom drained the country from Treponti and
Terracina, and restored the Appian way, which the neglect of the
marshes in the previous reigns had rendered nearly impassable. Dur-
ing the convulsion of the following centurieS, the marshes were again
overflowed, until again drained in the reign of Theodoric. They were
never, however, completely exhausted of their water until the pontifi-
cate of Pius 6th; though many preceding Popes had made the experi-
ment. During the French invasion, however, the precautions neces-
sary to keep open the two canals of communication were neglected, and
the waters began again to stagnate. These marshes, therefore, are
again formidable at the present day, and, though contracted in their
limits, still corrupt the atmosphere for many miles around.—“ The
Gallinariau forest” was in the same neighbourhood.

308. Sic, “ in such shoals.”-Huc, to Rome.— Vivaricz, “ pre-
serves,¹’ “ vivaries.'' They come to Rome as though to vivaries‚ for
they will get abundanee of prey there.

309. Graves—catam, chains are forged in every furnace, but such
is the number of robbers that there are not chains enough for them.--
Inous, &xpm—Graves ‘⁶ massive.”

310. BIaximus, &c. “The greatest quantity of iron is taken up in
making chains, so that you may well have fears lest a ploughshare be
wanting, lest mattocks and hoes should fail.”-Sarculnm, α sarri-
endo, Varro, (σκαλίς. mammaeam) “a hoe,” chiefly used in weeding
gardens, corn fields and vineyards. It was sometimes used to cover the
seed when sown, and in mountainous countries served instead of a
plough—bsodus, aierem—understand consumitur.

311. Marra. This word still exists in Italian, French, and Spanish.
Hesychius also gives μάῤῥον.-8ανσιιῖωη, qu. sarriculum, from sarrie,
‘⁴ to hoe.”

312. Proavorum atavos, ‘⁴ our earliest progenitors‚’' “ our far remote
ancestors.’' The order of ascent is pater, avus, proavus, abavus, ata-
vus, and trimma—dicas, ‘¹ well mayest thou pronounce.''

313. Tribunis. The military tribunes with consular power, i. e. who
had the same power and dignity as the consuls, were for the first time
chosen instead of consuls, A.1.'.c. 310. The people desired that the
consuls should be elected from their body. The patricians and senate
were opposed to this, and would not allow the consulate to be contami-
nated by the ignoble (plebeii) ; but when they perceived that they could
not hinder the proposal from being passed eventually‚ they contrived
that instead of consuls there should be chosen Tribuni militum con-
sulari potestate, the number of whom was not fixed ; there were some·
times three, sometimes four, sometimes six. The year 388 was the last
of Tribuni mil. cons. potes. for in 389 consuls were again elected; one,
of the name of Sextius, being from the people. After this the consulate
remained established. The origin of the Tribuni plebis, “ tribunes of the
commons,” was as follows. When the commons were oppressed by debt,
and were maltreated by their creditors‚ and received no protection from
the senate, in the year of the city 261 they removed from Rome to the
hill called Mons sacer, and did not return until the senate granted them
