or rather tried to imitate Lucilius; but failed. “Hoc (scil. satiricum

Varro spoken of above, but to P. Terentius Varro, who was born Ab.

village of Gallia Narbonensis, or from the river Atax in the same country.
Besides his Satires, he wrote a poem entitled “ De Bello Sequanico,’' and
translated the Argonautica of Apollonius Rhodius. He was the author
also of several epigrams and elegies.

We have no knowledge, even by name. of the others referred to by
Horace, as authors in the style of the Lucilian Satire. Casaubon men-
tions Saevius, or Suevius Nicanor (vid. supr.), and Lenoeus; but it is not
likely, according to Ruperti, that they were of this 01355. The latter
scholar substitutes Lucius, or rather Titus Albutius, mentioned by Varro
(De Re Rustica, 3. 2, 17). He was contemporary with Lucilius, who
speaks of him often in 1115 Satires. Julius Florus, who lived in the time
of Horace, wrote Satires which comprehended the Ennian, Lucilian, and
Varronian styles. Horace inscribed to him Epist. 3, lib. 1; and 2. 2.

After Horace's time many pursued this species of Satire; the most
celebrated of which writers were Persius and Juvenal. Twnus, a
native of Aurunca, is highly praised for his writings, by Martial3 also

both as regards his satirical and other poems. The names of Julius
Rufus, Cornutus, Gavius Bassus. aud Rabirius or Rubrius, are handed
down to us in connexion with Satires of this class: but Ruperti is rather
inclined to doubt that the first wrote Satires. and that the others wrote
after the model of Lucilius. Martial (10. 90) mentions Rufus: but
Wernsdorf maintains that Martial does not allude to him as a satin-icat
writer. Annaeus Cornutus, thc stoic philosopher and tragic poet. was
Persius* instructor. That he was the author of Satires appears from
the words of Fulgentius: ¹¹ M. Cornutus in Satyra ait. dxc. ;” and
therefore Casaubon thinks that the words ¹· pallentes radere mores.
