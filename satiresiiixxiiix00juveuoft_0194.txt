present passage are utensils for extinguishing fires. These may have
been wooden shovels, used for throwing water, as we now see them
employed in some countries abounding in pools and canals (Smith's
Dici. ⁰f Gr. aud Rom. Antiq. ) The word' is generally thought to sig-
nify‘ ‘leathern water-buckets;” its first syllable is short, while that of
hamus, ‘⁴ a hook‚'’ is long.

306. Licinus. A very wealthy individual, put here for any rich man.
—Attonitus pro Electro, ‘¹ in terror for his amber ;'' scil. vessels made
of amber. The Greeks applied the term ’Ἠλεκτρον to three distinct
substances. (l) To a metallic substance compounded of gold and
silver. (2) To the Crystalline stone or Crystallized quartz. (3) To
Ainber ( S uccinum, Pliny.)

307. Phiyyid columna. Synnas or Synnada, a city of Phrygia, was
celebrated for its marble.

308. Ebora et ῑαιά testudine. scil. Articles of furniture which were
either ornamented or made of these—Bolia. (stc, ‘⁸ The cask (singular
for plural) of the half-clad Cynic does not take fire ;” therefore Diogenes,
iu all his poverty, must have been a happier man than Licinus, who was
in perpetual sear of his house being burned. The eask of Diogenes was
of baked clay .--Nudz'. -The Cynies used to leave one arm aud shoulder
bare their cloak being thrown over the other.

309. Cyme-i, scil. Dioyenis. This philosopher was born at Sinope m
Asia Minor He was taken prisoner by pirateS‚ and ev entually died in
slavery at Corinth, B.C. 324 in his ninety-sixth year. Antisthenes
was his instructor in philosophy. IIe shewed an unbending contempt ’
for luxury, in his manners, dress. and conversation. He wore a coarse
eloak ; carried a wallet and staff ; made the porticoes and other places
his habitation; and depended on casual contributions for his daily
bread. A friend, whom he had desired to procure him a cell, not exe-
cuting his order soon enough for his wishes, he took up his abode in a
tub or large vessel in the Mem-‚um [the temple of the mother os the
gods at Athens} It is probable. however, that this was only a tem-
porary expression of indignation and contempt, and that he did not
make a tub the settled place of his residence. This famous tub is
indeed celebrated by Juvenal, ridiculed by Lucina, and mentioned by
Seneca. But no notice is taken of so singular a circumstance by other
ancient writers, who have mentioned this philosopher: not even by
Epictetus, who discourses at large concerning Diogenes. and relates
many particulars respecting his manner of life. It. may therefore be
questioned whether this whole story is not to be ranked among the
numerous tales which have been invented to expose the sect of the
Cynics to ridicule.
