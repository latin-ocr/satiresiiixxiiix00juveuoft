from Italy.

Consuls, L. Nonius Asprenas Torquatus, and M.
Arricinius Clemens.

Acilius Glabrio, who had been consul with Trajan,
is put to death by Domitian's order, together with
Herennius Senecio, L. Junius Rusticus (Sat. 15.
27), Sallustius Lucullus, AElius Lamia, Metius
Pompeianus, ὥσ. (Sat. 4. 94. seqq).

About this time, probably, Domitian (as Claudius
did before him) banishes the Jews from the city,
and the grove of the Muses (which had been con-
secrated by Numa) is let to them (Sat. 3. 13 ; 6.
542).

Consuls, Imp. Fl. Domitian (17th time) and T.
Flavius Clemens.

Domitian, having destroyed almost the whole nobi-
lity, begins to wreak his cruelty on the common-
alty, and is killed (Sat. 4. 153). Death of P.
Papinius Statius the Poet.

M. Cocceius Nerva ascends the throne, to whom it
is likely that the commencement of Sat. 7 refers.

Consuls, Caius Manlius Valens and Caius Antistius
Vetus.

Death of Nerva, who is succecded by M. Ulpius
Nerva Trajanus, who is by some considered to be
the person referred to in the beginning of Sat. Τ.

Consuls, Imp. Cocceius Nerva, (4th timc,) and Caes.
Ulpius Trajan (2d time).

Marius Priscus, governor of Africa, is accused of
extortion by Pliny the younger, and condemned
(Sat. 1. 47, and 8. 120). 'One of this year’s con-
suls, M. Cornelius Fronto, the distinguished orator
and patron of learning, lends his house to the poets
to recite in.

Consuls, Marcus Cornelius Fronto, the 3d time,
with Trajan (3d time).

Martial the poet dies in his native town of Bilbilis,
in Celtiberia, to which he repaired from Rome,
An. Ch. 100, (or according to Dodwell, 103), and
died shortly after. His epigrams show that he
was on the most intimate terms with Juvenal. It
is conjectured from the strain of some epigrams
which Martial composed after his return to Bil-
bilis, that Juvenal was then in Rome, not in
Egypt·

Publ. Juventius Celsus, a famous advocate, is Prae—
tor this year (6. 245; 8. 194).

‚Consuls, Trajan (the eth time [i. e. according to

Ruperti, but it should bc certainly the fourth
time]) and Sex. Articuleius Paetus.
