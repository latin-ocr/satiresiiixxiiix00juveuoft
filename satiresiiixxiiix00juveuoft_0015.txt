Consuls‚ P. Marius Celsus and L. Asinius Gallus.
[Ruperti assigns these consuls to the next. year:
others, to 814. The series, however, of the years
according to Ruperti's date would not coincide
with the date of the consuls for 820, as given by

, him].
816 ἰ 63 22 On the death of Burrus, C. Sofonius Tigellinus is
l placed over the praetorian bands by Nero, whose
j spirit was congenial with his own. Aulus Persius
² Flaccus dies. Nero weds Poppaea Sabina, who
i so rioted in luxury that, wheresoever she jour-
neyed, she had 500 asses to give her milk, an
article which the Roman ladies used, to make the
skin white and tendor. See Lempriere, Class.
Dict. Art. Poppaea.

Consuls, P. Marius Celsus and Lucius Asinius Gal-
lus, according to Ruperti. [But it is more pro-
bable that they were Caius Memmius Regulus
and P. Virginius Rufus, and that Persius died in
26 A.D.]

about forty. Hence he is called “facundus’' by
Martial ; and there is hardly a Satire which is
not evidently the productiori of a mind formed by
the exercise of declamation, according to the cus-
tom of that age.

against Nero, dies (he bled himself to death):
with him perished others of great wealth, who

: were partners in the conspiracy: among others

ἷ Plautius Lateranus, consul elect; L. Annaeus

J! Seneca, and M. Annaeus Lucanus the poet. See
