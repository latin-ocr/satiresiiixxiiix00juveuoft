ance of despotism, stationed only three of these cohorte in the capital,
and dispersed the remainder in the adjacent towns of Italy. Tiberius,
however, under pretence of introducing a stricter discipline among them,
assembled them all at Rome in a permanent camp, which was strongly
rortified. Vitellius increased their number to sixteen cohor-ts, or 16,000
men.-We may render the sentence beginning with vis certe, thus,
¹‘ Hast thou at least a hankering after centurionships and tribuneships ;
the distinguished horse-guards, and praetorian bands2''

96. Cupias. Cupere, ἱπιθυμεῖαθαι is to conceive a wish in the mind.
—Optare, εὔχεσθαι, is to express a wish.—Et‚ ‘⁶ even.” The meaning
is: even those of mankind who would shrink from the despotic exercise
of power, wish, nevertheless, to have all power in their own hands, in
order to ensure them respect or at least sear in others.

97. Sed quae praeclara, ὼε. “ what distinguished and fiourishing cir-
cumstances should be esteemed so highly [by you as to form the object
of your earnest wish]‚ even though (ut) this prosperity be attended by
au equal measure of evils 3¹⁹ Such is Ruperti’s method of rendering

this sentence. Several MSS. have tantum, according to which lection ²

the meaning deduced by the commentators is,—“ what circumstances
are so prosperous as not to have evils mixed up with them?'' But this
would require ut non, and not ut alone. Lubinus perceived this diffi-
culty, and emended thus, ut (i. e. quum) rebus loetz's par est mensura
laborum. It would be better, says Ruperti, to read quum rebus laetis
par sic mensura modorum ‚· or, quoe proeclara et prospera tanta (sum),
ut rebus, ἀει, in which case the sense would be, “what distinguished
and flourishing circumstances are so great as to have but an equal
amount of ill connected with them as they have good, and not rather
have more of the former than the latter2” The passage may be fairly
rendered ‘¹ what prosperity, dec„ is of such value‚ since (ut) an equal
mass of calamity will surely conie.”

99. Hujus, Sejani.—P›·oelcxta; the coya proetexca was a gown with
a broad purple border. lt was derived originally from the Etruriam,
and was worn by children of both sexes, with the bulla. It was also
worn by the dictator, the consuls, the praetors, (who laid it aside when
about to condemn a Roman citizen to death), the augurs, (who, how-
ever, are supposed by some to have worn the trabea), by the. decemviri
sacris faciundis, the AEdiles. the triumviri epulones, the senators on
festival days, the mayistm' colleyii, and by the magyislri vicorum when
celebrating games. ln the case of the tribum* plebis, the censors, and
quaestors, there is some doubt upon tho subject. Ferrarius tells us that
the praefects of the praetorian camp [such as Sejanus was]‚ wore the
proeteoeta, but not thc lutus clavus. The idea contained from line 9⁰ to
102, inclusive, is as follows x—wouldst thou rather fill even the most
elevated situation, and bc surronndcd with the most gorgeous insignia
os pomp, when such pomp would be fraught with danger of life, or
wouldst thou rather be one of limited influence and narrow means, and
enjoy at the same time the feeling of perfect security? Surely thou
wouldst make choico os the latter, “· therefore. &03⁹ (line 103).
