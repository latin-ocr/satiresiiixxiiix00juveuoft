Pompey, 283 ; Lucretia, 293 ; Virginia, 294 ; Hippolytus and Bellero-
phon, 325 ; and Caius Silius, 330.

As they appear in succession, he shows, from the principal events of
their lives, in how small a degree happiness can be promoted by the at-
tainment of what our indistinct and bounded views represent as the most
perfect of earthly blessings, 1—11.

Of these he instances, Wealth, 12—27 ; Power, 56—113: Eloquence.
114—132 ; Military Glory, 133—187; Longevity, 188-2883 and Per-
sonal Accomplishments, 289—345 ; all of which have, as he observes,
proved dangerous or destructive to their respective possessor&

Hence, he argues the wisdom of acquiescing in the dispensations of
Heaven ; and concludes with a form of prayer, in which he points out,
with great force and beauty, the objeets for which a rational being may
presume to approach the Almighty, 346—366.

Juvenal probably had the second Alcibiades of Plato, and the second
Satire of Persius, in his thought; he has taken nothing from them,
however, but the general idea. The filling up is entirely his own, and it
is done with a boldness of imagery‚ and with an awful and impressive
sublimity of style and manner, of which it would perhaps be difficult
to find another example in any composition merely human.—Gifford,
Ruperti.

The same subject has been handled by Luciam (Icarom. p. 205. and
Navig. s. Vota p. 491. t. ii. ed. Graev.) Aristotle and other Greeks,
(eng) εὐχῆς.) Xenophon; (Mem. 1. iii. 1.) V. Maximus, vii. ii. ext. l.
(Rup.) Epictetus, (Enchirid.), and by Dr Johnson in his celebrated
imitation, “ The Vanity of Human Wishesss’

Bishop Buruet recommends this Satire (together with Persius) to
the serlous perusal and practice of the divines in his diocese, as the
source of best commonplaces for their sermons; as the store-house
and magazine of moral virtues, whence they rnay draw out, as they
have occasion, all manner of assistance for the accomplishment of a
virtuous life.—Madan.

The Poet declares, in the commencement of this Satire, the origin
and source of human wishes generally3 namely, the mistaken views
which men take of true blessings.

 

1. Omnibus in terris, dcc. “ In all the lands which extend from Gades
even to the East and the Ganges, but few (having the mist of prejudice
removed) can distinguish things of real advantage, from those that are
essentially the contrary.”

1. Gadibus, i. e. the extreme west. Gades (—ium), or Gadis (is),
Greek Γάδειρα, now called Cadiri‚ a flourishing commercial city of
Spain, at the mouth of one of the arms of the Boezis. It was founded
by a Phoenician colony about 1500 13.c.; but others say that it is coeval
with Utica, which was founded 287 years before Carthago. Its name
iu Phcenician was Gaddir, and signified “ a hedge,‘' or ‘·1imit,” as it
was thought that here were the western limits of the world. Hercules,
surnamed Gaditanus, had there a celebrated temple. Silius Italicus
calls Gades ‘⁴ hominum finis,’' 1. 141. Gades came into the power of
the Carthaginians in the first Punic war, and in the second surrendered
itself voluntarily to the Romans. From Julius Caesar it received the
name and privileges of a Roman colony; and in a later age it was styled
Anqusta Julia Gaditana.

2. Auroram. This word is here, like the Greek ἧως, employed merely
to signify “ the farthest East.” It is by some derived from aurea Ιιονα,
