13.c. 1050, by some Greeks of Euboea, under the conduct of Hippocles
01 Cumae (or rather Cyme—Kuipan—of AEolia), and Megasthenes of
Chalcis. It was famous for the cave of the Sibyl, μαντεῖον, which con-
sisted 01 0110 vast chamber hewn out of the solid rock. The existence
of this cavern is not fabulous; it was almost entirely destroyed in a
siege, which the fortress of Cumae, then in possession of the Goths,
maintained against Narses, who, by undermining the cave, caused the

citadel to sink into the hollow, and thus involved the whole in one com· ,

4. “ It [scil. Cumae] is the great thoroughfare, or key, to Baiae, and
its shore is a welcome.-and delightful retreat.'’ Janua, i. e. persons on
their way to Baiae had to pass through Cumae.--Baiae was a fashionable
watering-place, situated on the bay of Naples ; and is said to have been
founded by Baius, one of the companions of UlysseS. It was the usual-
resort of the wealthy Romans, who occupied with villas the whole line
of coast, and frequently erected piers projecting into the sea, for bathing
lodges.——Litzcs (from lino “to make a stroke or line'') is properly ⁴‘ the
line of coast that borders on the sea.’'—Amoenus is from ἀμείνων, and
usually refers 1ο that which is agreeable to the sight, as a fine view,
&eq while suavis is said especially of that which is agreeable to the
senses, particularly to the hearing, smell, and taste; 01111113 “ precious,''
refers especially to the value of a thing to ourselves3 and sucnxnus is
said of that which directly administers pleasure.

less agreeable spot, I would not censure his resolve, for] Ι prefer even
Prochyta [that barren rock] to the Subura.”—-Prochyta (hodie Procida
or Procita) was 11 small island off Cape Misenus, and received its name
from προχώρει, because it was thought to have been rent from AEnaria
by an earthquake, and ihi-own forth, as it were, into the sea. It is
called alta by Virgil, AEn. 9, 715. and aspera by Statius, in Sylv. 11.
2. 76.—Subura, (so called from sub urbe, because it was at the foot 01
Mouut Coelius) is generally alleged to have been the residence 01 1110
vile and abandoned, but so 1111· from this. it was in reality the abode 01
1110 great and gay. Julius Cmsar was born in that part os the Subura
which was situated on 1110 Esquilino hill. Some derive 1110 name from
Saburra, a marsh, and Junius, cited by Varro, thinks it to be 11 contrac-
tion from sub murum ,· quia subest ei loco. qui terreus mnu-ns vocatur.
