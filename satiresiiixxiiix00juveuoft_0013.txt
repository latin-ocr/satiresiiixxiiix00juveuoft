fore than after this ‚rear : sor the 13th Satire was
written sixty-one years after the consulship of
Fonteius, i. e., in A.u.c. 873; supposing that C.
Fonteius Capito is meant, who was consul. mr. c.
812, and not Lucius Fonteius Capito. who was
consul, A.1:.c. 820. In the same :tear (scil. 8⁵:34,
or rather in the next, he wrote, or recired, Sat.
15, but at, the age of eight5 he was sent to Egypt,
and there (according to Suetonius, if he be worthy
of credit) he died, in a very short time, a pre}- to
mental disqm'etude. Dodwell supposes that Quin-
tilian, the rhetorician, was born in 795, and J uve-
nal, in 791. An.Ch. 33. Tiberius Claudius Dru-
sus then reigned (who was on the throne from
A. ῦ. c. 794 to 807, An. Ch. 41 to 54). Caius
Caesar Caligula. had been emperor before Tib.
Claud. from mue. 790 to 794, An. Ch. 37 to 41.
In 791 he was said to have been rendered insane
by a love philtre given him by his wife Caesonia,
(Sat. 6. 615). In 793 he had instituted a contest
of Greek and Latin oratory at Lyons (Sat. 1. 44.
aud 7 . 147 seqq.), at which time also he probably
banished Secundus Carinas, the rhetorician, (see
Sat. 7. 204). Caligula had succeeded Tiberius.
of whose retirement at Capreae, see Sat. 10. 56.
His residence there lasted from A.u.c. 780 to 790.
Nothing is recorded of our poet's parents except
the allusion of Suetonius, ‘⁴ J uvenalis libertini
locupletis incertum filius an alumnus.¹' His
praenomen was Decimus, not· Decius. By the
ancient copyists, and by many writers of the
modern age, he is termed “ Ethicus i. e. the
moralist‚’' on account of the many moral precepts
interwoven with his Satires. Other satiric poets
have from several writers received their peculiar
titles for particular reasons. (As Martial is called
