xxxii REMARKS ON THE STYLEs or

though he were aiming at something else, and gives the vicious oftener
a slight wound than a home-thrust ; while he by no means spares him-
self, in order to have a just license to reprove others. Persius sifts and
examines errors according to the opinions of the Stoics, and tries vices
by the rules of rigid virtue; he either glows with genereus ardour or
harshly gives vent to gloomy passion, Juvenal either inculcates virtue
with dignified gravity, and acts the part of an austere instructor ; or,
fired with anger and indignation, he inveighs, for the most part, against
the vices themselves,—sometimes lashing them with severity‚—some-
times raising against them the laugh of broad reproof and scorn [cachin-
nus]. ‘⁴ Inasmuch‚’' says Koenig, ‘¹ as he lived among men whose minds
had become callous, and intellects dull, by the long continuance of
vicious practices, he could hardly employ that refined humour and plea-
santry, those profound and keen witticisms, which had so distinguished
Horace: add tp this, that the man whose indignation is thoi-oughly
roused by villany and baseness, cannot be sparing of his abuse, can
utter nothing in sportive humour. On the contrary, he brings into odium
things worthy of blame, and that gentle and pleasant laugh of ridicule
[risus] which he may have used when unexcited, changes now to one of
angry censure.‘’ Yet he often tempers his Archilochian severity by a
little inirth, and his gravity by agreeable urbanity. In his earlier Satires,
chiefly, he displays hai-shness to a great extent; hut in those 11 hich seem
to be the fruit of his advaneed years and more matured genius, the heat
of anger had evidently abated and had yielded to coldness of declama-
tion ; in these, too, individuals are seldomer and less rancorously assailed‚
exactly as in the Epistles of Horace.

Persius borrows almost all his precepts and weapons of offcnce from
the portico and the school; Horace and Juvenal take theirs from that
genuine and popular philosophy which is derived from extensive worldly
expcrience and intimate knowledge of mankind, and which adapts itself
to the prevailing state of feeling or condition of things, or to the nature
oi' the subject to be handled. Persius, blindly attached to the lise and
doctrine of the Stoics, does not see what is displeasing in either; where-
as the inorals, personal appearance, the paradoxes, subtiltieS, pride,
hypocrisy, and other faults peculial· to thc Stoic and Cynic philosophers
chiefly, supply Horace and Juvenal with niaterials sor ridicule and
wrath. Persius’s reasoning is scholastic and excoedingly subtile, so that
it does not rcadily penetrate into the mind: that os the other two is
simple and clear, adaptcd to the humblest capacity, formed on the basis

acquired by much experience of the world, and which lias mors real utility in
respect to all tho relations of lise. He wished to teach, to instruct, to root out
the eri-ors by which the minds of men were beset; 1ο remove wrong and rashly
formed views·‚ to show how ono may live to the best advantage, sasely‚ peace—
fully, hononrably, and with pleasure to hin1self; and all this he wished to tench
in surh 11 way as not to ochiid his render hy 11 master‘s harshneae, by 11 philoso-
