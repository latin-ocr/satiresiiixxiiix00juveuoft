SATIRE x111. 113

regard to the second, it does not appear that he entirely denied the ’
existence of superior powers, although his misconceptions with respect
to mechanical motion, and the nature of divine happiness, led him to
devest the deity of som'e of his primary attributes. The other charges
against him seem scarcely compatible with his general character ; but
his successors perverted his doctrines, and ran into the most fearfnl
sensuality.—l23. Suspicit. This verb denotes admiration, with a sense
of one's own inferiority to the object admired z Revereor denotes silent
admiration: Admiror admiration with evident emotion.—Horii. Epicu-
rus was the first who introduced the fashion of having gardens to town-
houses.

124. Dubii oeqri, “ the dangerously sick.”

125. Tu, dac. Yours is not a desperate case, you need not sear to be
bled even by the apprentice of a second-rate practitioner. So I am
sufficient to console you, although no great philosopher like Epicurus—
ει little common sense is what Ι shall employ.

126. Tam detestabile factum, scil. as that which your false friend was
guilty of towards you.

127. Nec puqnis, dxc. “ I forbid you neither to beat your breast with
your lists, nor violently to smite your face with the palm of your hand,’'
i. e. to exhibit all the signs of frantie grief.

129. Quando quidem, dic. ‘⁴ Since, when a loss has been sustained,
the door must be shut, and since money (i. e. the loss of money) is
lamented with more earnest grief, with more thorough disci-der of a
family than even the death of some of its members,'’ because in the
case of a death one may be a gainer. It is still the practice to close
the doors and windows of the house as an emblem of deep mourning.

132. In hoc casu, scil. in the “ case” of lost money.— Vestem deslu-
cere summam, (hc. “so as to be satisfied with merely stripping down
the upper part of the garment (without tearing it), and to hurt the eyes
by forcing out a tear.’' Persons who have sustained a loss in money—
matters do not counterfeit grief ; they tear their gai-ments, which was a
sign of genuine affliction. The reading deducere occurs in many MSS,
and is to⁴ be interpreted thus “distrahere tantum, pectoris medandi
playendique causa‚'' but the present reading is preferable—Hiemem
coacto, Comp, Luc. angiim ἐπιτλάστων.

134. Veris, “ genuine.’'

135. Simili qaere’lo‘i, “ complaint similar to your own,⁷¹ namely, the
retention of a deposit by a false friend.

136. Si, decies, dxc. “ If, after their bonds have been read over ten
times, and in different places, they assert that the signature of the in-
valid deed is a forgery, whom even their own hand-writing convicts, and
also that valuable gem, the Sardonyx (their seal), which is safely kept
in an ivory casket, do you think, Ο silly man, that you are to be ex-
cepted from the common lot of humanity2’'

137. Liyni, literally, “ of their wooden tablet.'’

139. Sardonychas, MSS. have different readings, Sardonycha, Sar-
donyclzis, Sardonychum. Achaintre affirms that no MSS. read Sar-
donychas, which Ruperti has restored, although he acknowledges Juvenal
is the only author who used the form.

139. Localis eburnis. Hence we may infer that the practice of per-
jury was not confined to the lower orders.

140. Ο Delicias! may also be rendered “ridiculous stuff.'' Mauso
would read Ten’ et delicias, and explain the latter word “thy money
which was a source of delight to thee.⁰' The meaning then is, ‘⁴ do you
