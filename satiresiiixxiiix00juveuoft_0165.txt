SATIRE x111. 119

219. Continuo videt templum in somnis, dio. “ Instantly in his
slumbers he sees the temple (where he committed the perjury) and the
altars of the profaned divinity‚ and, what oppresses his soul with pangs
beyond all else, your form also he beholds: your heaven-sent shade,
larger, too, than life, appals the conscience-strichen wretch.’' Sacra
might also mean ⁴⁴ accursed ;” but the ancients believed apparitions to
be sacred3 and as sear magnifies its objects, they were always supposed
to appear larger than the life, especially in solitude, at night, and
in dreams.

224. Exanimes, ὥσ. “ Breathless with terror at even the first rum-
bling of the skies,'' i. c. at the first peal of thunder.

225. Non quasi, dic. ‘⁵ As though the fire of IIeaven, falls not
chance-directed upon the earth, or from the violence of the blasts, but
comes on a mission of wrath, and is fraught with retributire justice.’'—-
Portunus tynis, the Epicureans thought that the thunderbolt was for-
tuitous; compare cmm· iquos, AEneid 4. 209. The student will observe
that the penultima of fortuitus is here short, though other writers have
it long ; thus Hor. ⁴‘ Neo fortuitum spernere ccspitemssss— Ventorum
rabie, i. e. from the violence of the winds occasioning a collision of the
clouds.-2'ratus, i. e. sent by the deity in his wrath: thus iracunda
fulmina, Hor. Od. 1. 3. 40.-]ιι(ἰίοετ, some MSS. have vindicet.

227. Illa nihil nocuit. “ That storm (suppose) has done them no
injury.‘’

228. Sereno, “ fair weather.”

229. Laberis, &o “ Pain of the side, attended with a restless‚” or
‘¹ sleepless fever.⁷' The pleurisy is meant.

230. Missum, &o ‘² They believe the malady to have been sent against
their frames by the incensed divinity; these (scil. the dolor lateris and
the febris) they esteem to be the stones and darts of the gods.” Poignant
diseases were believed to be sent by the arrows of Apollo and Diana.
Plagae, pestilence, and disease, no less than thunder and lightning,
were reckoned among the weapons with which heaven's arsenals were
furnished.

230. Non, dic. They dare not offer a sacrifice for their recovery, as they
are well aware that they have incurred the hostility of the gods.—— S pon-
<lere sacello, “ to vow to their chapel‚’' i. e. to offer up in the chapel, (hc.
Sacellum is a diminutive of sacer, and signifies a small place, consecrated
to a god, containing an altar, and sometimes a statue of the god to
whom it was dedicated. Festus completes the definition by stating
that a sacellum never had a roos. It was therefore a sacred enclosure
surrounded by a fence or wall to separate it from the profane ground
around it, and answers to the Greek περίβολος. The form of a sacellum
was sometimes square and sometimes round. Many Romans had pri-
vate sacella 011 their own estates; but the city of Rome contained a
great number of public sacella, such as that of Caca, of Hercules in the
Forum Boarium, of the Lares, of Nienia, of Pudicitia, and others.

233. Criscam yallz‘, “ A crested cock,” a periphrasis. It was cus-
tomary, on recovery from illness, to offer a ceck to AEsculapius. The
ancients were led by superstition to seek remedies for numerous diseases
from cocks. Pliny states that their entrails were most acceptable to
the gods. He also says that the comb of a cock pounded, and applied
to a dog, which had been bitten by another when rabid, was productive
of good effect. Allusion, perhaps, may be made to the last sacrifice of
Socrates.
