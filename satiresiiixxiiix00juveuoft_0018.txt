BRIEF CHRONOLOGY.

called by Juvenal, Ultimus Flavius, Nero Calvus.
and Pontifex Maximus: Sat. 4. 37, 38, 46, 137.
His reign was similar to that of Nero. The most
noted informers at this time were Baebius Massa
(Sat. 1. 53), Metius Carus (1. 36), Palfurius Sura
(4. 53), Armillatus (Ibid.), Pompeius (4. 110),
Catullus Messalinus (4. 113), and Fabricius Vei-
ento (3. 185, &c). Pegasus and Rutilius Gal-
licus were prefects of the city under Domitian.
Sat. 4. 75; 13. 157.

Consuls, M. Plautius Silvanus and M. Annius Verus
Pollio.

Domitian,having made a ridieulous expedition against
the Catti, receives from the senate the cognomen
Germanicus, and is awarded a triumph. He re-
pudiates Domitia, and puts Paris to death for adul-
terous intercourse with her (Sat. 7. 87 ). He then
openly cohabits with Julia, the daughter of his
brother Titus.

Consuls, Imp. T. Fl. Domitianus (9th time) and Τ.
Virginius Rufus (2d time).

Domitianus (the lOth time), nnd Appius Junius
Sabinus are consuls. Some think that it is this
Junius who is alludcd to in Sat. 15, 27.

War is begun with the Daci, in which App. Jun.
Sabinus and Cornelius Fuscus perish. Domitian
at length, after a protracted war, obtains (845) a
peace from the enemy, on'condition that he should
pay them a yearly tribute ; however he is awarded
a triumph, and takes the cognomen of Dacicus
(see Sat. 4, 111 ; 6. 205). Perhaps atthis period
also the eouncil of the senators was summoned by
Domitian, (Sat. 4, 37. dxc..) to deliberate concern-
ing the gigantic turbot, beforo Fuscus should de-
part against the Daci; while at the same time
intelligence of an evil character was arriving from
Britain, and from thc Catti and Sigambri. For
tho persons who were present at the eouncil, see
Sat. 4. 75, to 113.

Consuls, Imp. Τ. Fl. Domitianus (llth time) and
T. Aurelius Fulvius.
