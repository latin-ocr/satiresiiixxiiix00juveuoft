1augh‚’' καγχασμὸι. Wakefield rightly informs us that the reading ma-
jore cachinno arose from a gloss.

102. Nec dolet, “yet does not sincerely grieve,'’ but only pretends
to mourn.-19nicuzum brumae, dxc. ‘¹ If you should call for a spark of
fire in winter-time, he sports his dread-nought.”-Bruma‚ contracted
from brevissima, not from βραχὺ ἦμαρ-Τὼ endromis was a Gallie
coat, rough and woolly, which was put on in the gymnasium after violent
exercise, in order to prevent eold. The ἐνδρομίδας of the Greeks were
shoes, which they used in the root-racc.

104. Non sumus, dxc. ‘⁴ We are no match, then [for these Greeks, in
fascinating manners ,]” or rather “we are not equal to them [in the good
graces of the wealthy].”

114. Transi yymnasia, either‘ ‘pass over,’ “omit to mention their
athletic pursuitsss’ i e. never mind at present talking of their less fla-
grant excesses, such as their becoming adepts in pugilism, (ke. (Comp.
line 68); or‘ ‘pass on [in thought] to their schools of philosophy.” —
The yymnasia, according to the first view, were public places or build-
ings, (in Greece), where the youth praetised wrestling, throwing, dxc. ςΔ
according to the second view, the word signifies here those public
schools‚ where youth were taught philosophy 3 of these there were three

at Athens, namely the Academia, Lyceum, and Cynosaryes.

115. Facinus majoris abolloe, “a crime of the greater abolla,'’ i. e.
“ of a Greek philosopher, scil. Egnatius.” The abolla denoted both the
military eloak called sagnam, and the loose outer garment of others,
philosophers especially. It is here called majoris, because philosophers
wore it longlar or lai-ger than others; or, ‘¹ more dignified,” as the Stoics
above all were a most rigid sect. The word is qu. ambella, from ἄμφιβολῆ,
or from ἀναβολή. Probably Juvenal intends to mean, that the crime is
so enormous as to require a larger eloak to hide it. This is supported
by the authority of the ancient scholiast on J uvenal. who explains
majoris abollae as equivalent to majoris Pallii.'' Smyth's. Dict. Antiq.

116. Stoicus. This is not Heliodorus (who insormed against Licinius
Silanus, not Barea, l. 33); but Publius Egnatius Celer, who “pro-
eured the death of'' (occidit, ἐθανάτωσε) Barca Soranus, amost amiable
man, by false testimony. Egnatius was himself condemned to death
afterwards under Vespasian, on the accusation of Masonius Rufus.—
Occidit. by a popular method of speaking] a person is said to do a thing
himself, when he has aecomplished it by the instrumentality ot‘ another.
Damnare and condemnare are very osten used thus—Damon συκοφάντης,
on which word, by the way, we may remark. that tho commonly received
explanation is hardly correct: nanicly. that it denoted 0110 who insormed
against an individual sor exporting figs. σῦκα, from Attica. a law being in
existence which sorbade their exportation. It is probable that this law
is a figment deviscd by the old scholiasts to account for the etymology:
sor we have no traco whatever lest of such an enaotment. It is better
10 refer the origin os the word to those who informed against persons sor
stealing figs out of the Sacrcd Grovc.
