XXX REMARKS ΟΝ ΤΗΕ STYLES OF

moderation, honour, and magnanimous spirit of ancient Rome; the laws
of their country, liberty, religion, were utterly disregarded by the citi-
zens ; their audacious contempt of Heaven was equalled by their obse-
quious fawning to superiors, and by their effeminate superstition. Dig-
nities were conferred‚ not on the meritorious, but on the wealthy or on
the base ; their minds were totally averse to all grave studies and pur·
suits; luxury and lasciviousness had almost annihilated every particle
of physical and mental energy ; those who professed to be philosophers
(with the exception, perhaps, of the Stoics, Seneca, Cornutus, and a
few others) being led away by the allurements of pleasure, adopted the
system of Aristippus or Epicurus ; or, merely from a love for disputa-
tion, embraced the system of the Academy ; or, from vain ostentation,
affected the gravity of the Stoics, not in their morals, but in their lan-
guage and peculiarities of personal appearance ; or else, attaching them·
selves to no sect, they roamed, like bees, whithersoever their fancy led
them. Eloquence too, when freedom and the right of elections were
wrested by Tiberius from the people, was degraded from its forensic
brightness to the expressing of sulsome panegyrics in the senate, and to
the pleading of mimic causes, in the retirement of schools for youth z
the natural result of which waS, that oratory soon turned aside from its
native elegance and truth, from its simplicity‚ weight, and sublimity, to
rhetorical subtilties and childish verbal ornament; to a sar-fetched
brilliancy and richness of expression, destitute, however, of strength or
nerve; and to a vain display of learning, and a straining after effect.
With regard to poetry, its style turned completely aside from that on
which it ought entirely to depend—namely, genius and correctjudgment
—to art and set rules, which, without the two other requisites, are, of
course, of no avait—for, though able to give additional force and proper
direction to a noble or fine sentiment, yet they cannot oriyinate one in
a person naturally destitute of talent. From this time forward the lan—
guage of the poem, in general, was filled with Eastern bombast, or else
barren in the extreme ; it varied much in words and phrases ; servilely
imitated the expressions of others; had a frigid copiousness, bold transi—
tions, harsh transpositions, unusual tropes and figures, many obsolete
words, and other faults too numerous for mention. This decline of
oratory and poetry was consonant with the spirit of that age, in which
men were receding from nature. and were forming their minds no longer
by the study of the Greek masters, and by an accurate knowledge of
life; but by the instructions of the grammarians and rhetoricians (who
were, for the most part. men of stolidity‚ and fond of displaying their
erudition). and by the constant practico of declamation and recitation-
In these times lived Persius and Juvenal 3 the former of whom died
at tho early age of twenty-eight or twenty-nine, in the ninth year of
Nero's reign ; tho latter. as wc elsewhere have stated, died at the age
of eighty, in Egypt. Persius was born at Volaterrae. in Etruria, and
was descended of a noble and wealthy family. llis first preceptora at
Rome were l'almmon tho Grammarian. and Virginius Rufus the Rhe—
torician: but from his sixteenth year he was under the celebrated Stoic
philosopher, Cornutus. lle was possessed of maman-like modesty. and
morals the most unblemished: he was the friend of virtue alone, and
the ceaseless enemy of vico ; but he was. perhaps. happier in imitating
Zeno and Chrysippus than Lucilius and Horace. llis Satires, unlike
lloracc's, were not published when they were written. but were known
only to the faithful friends to whom ho addressed them. as Cornutus,
Bassus, Plotius. Macrinus, ete.. who published them after the author‘s
