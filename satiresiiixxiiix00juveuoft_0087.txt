SATIRE 111. 41

‚foreign (Syrian, scil.) hai-lot :’' Barbarus is from the Punic berber “ a
shepherd.’' Picta [scil. acu] “adorned [with the needle'’] “ embroidered.'’

67. Rusticus ille, δια-11 is better 111 translating this and the follow-
ing line into English, to use the words ‘¹ treckedipna” and “ niceto-‘id'
than to have recourse to a periphrasis, especially since there is much
vai-ianoe of opinion respecting their signification ; some wishing τρεχέ-
&aava to signify “ a suit of livery ;” others, ‘⁴ a gymnastic dress,⁷’ ἰνδςομίῃ
others [with vestimenta understood], “ the garment with which one
hastens to a meal like a parasite; others “ Grecian shoes ;'’ others that
the φρεχὲδειπνι or τροχάδες were the same with the nice-teria; namely
‘⁵ prizes of victory which persons so entitled wore round the neck in
order to be recognised, and thereby admitted to the public feasts.''
Quirine “ Romulus :” the word is commonly derived from Quiris
(Sabin.) “ a spear;'’ or Cures, the Sabine town. A much preferable de-
rivation, however, is from Quiriam, the Sabine city on the Quirinal hill,
from which, on the amalgamation of the two people, was deduced the for—
mula, Populus RomanusQuiritium‚ i.e. ec Quirites, but see note 011 10, 91.

68. Et ceromatico, ‹ke—Juvenal in this line attacks that frenzied
attachment to gymnastic practices, which had been brought from Greece
(Comp. Hor. Epist. 2, 1. 32, and 33). The gladiatorial and agonistic
profession was regarded as infamous by the earlier Romans, but even
the nobility of J uvenal‘s day lowered themselves to the level of prize-
fighters.—Niceteria, vinna-ingan, prizes which they had won as pugilists.
Omnibonus, quoted by Achaintre, understands by mbeteria, prizes which
those parasites wore, who were most distinguished for their gluttony:
he also would be inclined to read for trechedipna‚ vichidimim,si. e.
napkins which they used at diunen-Ceromatico “ overspread with
ceroma.'’ The κῆςωμα was used to anoint prize-fighters.

69. Hic alta Sicyone, ‹tva—Juvenal returns now to the Greeks, and
mentions the places throughout Greece from which they come fiocking
to Rome—Sicyon the most ancient city of Achaia in Peloponnesus:
called here alta, because, as Strabo says, it was situated on the erest
of a hill, im λὸφον {eumin—Amydon, a town of Paeonia, a district of
Macedon (Hom. Il. β’, 849).—70. Andros one of the Cyclades— Samos
an island in the Icarian sea, (the last syllable of this word is not elided
here).— Tralles, a town of Ionia, or Caria, or Lydia—Alabanda a very
opulent city of Caria.--Esquiliae (—-arum, or Exqu. or AEsqu.) one of
the seven hills of Rome. Dictumque a vimine collem, “and the hill
which received its name from osiers‚’' scil. a wood of osiers, where there
was also an altar dedicated to Jupiter Viminius ; Juvenal uses a peri-
phrasis, because the word Vimimilis could not occur in a dactylic hexa-
meter. These two hills comprehended properly the fifth and largest
department of the city; but they are employed for the entire of the
latter. The hill Esquilioe is now called “ The Mount of St Mary the
Greater‚” and obtained its name from the esculi, “bay oaks” which
grew there.

72. Viscera, &c. “ soon to become the vital organs of high families,
and soon to have lordly sway therein.”-Viscera, this word, and also
ωηατ and medulloe, are employed to signify the inside of anything.
Marius Victor uses the first in a qood sense.

73. Inyenium velo-r, &c.—“ They have a ready⁰ or “ quick wit, brazen
effrontery, language at command, and of more rapid flow than that of
Isaeus.”—In51enium velox is opposed to inqenium tardum—Audacia
perdita, dae5v01oe.—Isaeo an adjective (scil.) sermone. There were two
celebrated orators called Jsaeus, (1) the preceptor of Demosthenes, who
