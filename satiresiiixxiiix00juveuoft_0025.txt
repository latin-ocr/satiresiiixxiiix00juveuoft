and in the circumstance of their being performed separately, and not
in connexion with tragedies [in which they were unlike the tragico-
satyric, Vid. supra]. ‘¹ The Latin Atellane fable (says Diomedes) differs
from the Greek Satyric, in that yenerally the characters of Satyrs are
introduced into the latter, or whatever other characters were of an
amusing nature, like the Satyrs, as Autolycus, Busiris ; in the Atellane
they were Oscan characters that were represented, as Maccus, for in-
stance.’' Now in these words of Diomedes two things are observable;
lst. The introduction of the Satyrs he judges to be foreign from.the
nature of the Atellanae fabulae ; and 2dly. It is not without limitation
that he allows their introduction into the satyric sables of the Greeks.
However, as there was no exception in the case of the tragico-satyrio,
it is probable that Diomedes took in the comico-satyrio, into his de—
scription, and that as he had assigned the satyrs to the tragic writers,
so also to these he ascribed Autolycus and Busiris.

The Romans, though late, yet did at length employ iambics also in
abusive effusions, after the example of the Greeks. Catullus, Biba-
culus and others, adopted them before Horace’s era, though the latter
lays claims to the introduction ‘¹ Parios ego primus Iambos Ostendi
Latio‚'’ Epis. 1. 19, 23. (alluding to some Epodes and Odes of his).
“The Iambus,” says Quintilian, “was not much dealt in by the
Romans, as though their proper composition. It was brought in by
some; and its severity of style is exhibited in the compositions of
Catullus, Bibaculus, and Horace; though in Catullus the Epodos is
not sound.”*

In addition to the species of Roman satire called δραματικῆ and διαλογιιιὴ,
which was the most ancient, and flourished before the time of Livius
Andronicus, and aster, under the name of Exodia, the satire διδακτικῆ
and δικγημιιτικὺ arose, which was of a two-sold character, Ennian and
Lucilian. The Varronian may be referred to the former. Quintus
Ennius was born at Rudii in Calabria near the Tarentine gulf 3 and
lived from mnne. 515 to 585. He enjoyed the si‘iendship of Scipio
Africanus the elder. Not only was this great poet the founder of the
epic poetry of the Romans, but was also “ rudis et Graecis intacti car-
minis (scil. didactic satire) auctor” for Sat. 1. 10, 66. The number of
satires which he wrote is a point still unsettled. Porphyrion speaks of
Book 4th; Donatus, Book 6'th (if it be not a mistake of the copyists);
and each book seems to have contained but one satire, sor which reason
the former, and not the satires are spoken of. From the very few
fragments which we have of these, we may infer with probability that
his compositions were of a varied nature, remarkable for diversity of
metre† and subject, sometimes in the form of dialogue, and treating of
matters to them from common life; keeping in view the general advan-
tage and the morals of mankind.

Caius Lucilius, a'Roman knight, the great maternal uncle of Pompey
the great, was born at Suessa. Aurunca, a town of Campania (hence
called “,Magnus‚Auruncae Alumnus'’ by Juv. 1. 20), aud lived from
A.U.c. 6οὗ to 651. He wrote thirty books of satires, or perhaps 30
Satires, only a few fragments of which remain to us. His satire differed
from the Ennian in being composed sor the most part in heroic metre,
iambic or trochaic being rarely employed; he also possessed more

* According to Gesner's interpretation the Epodos is a shorter verse following
a lona, as a dimeter following a trimeter, διο.

† ile employed dactylic, iambic, and trochaic, as in the Margites of Homer.
