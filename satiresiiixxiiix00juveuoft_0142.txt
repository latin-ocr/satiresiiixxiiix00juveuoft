96 sorus οΝ JUVENAL.

Pliny, however, does not represent her as yibbosa. It is probable that
she was some deformed woman of that day.

295. Suam (faciem et formam).—Filius autem, duc. ‘¹ But a son
with a beautiful person keeps his parents in perpetual misery and fear,’'
⁷ namely, lest his morals be corrupted

297. Rara, dvc. “ So rare* is the association of beauty and chastity.”

298. Sanctos licet, dxc. “ Though his rigidly austere family may have
transmitted him unblemished morals, and may have resembled [in
austerity], ‹im—Veteres Sabinos, many editions have Sabinas, which
seems to be in some measure defended by many passages in the Latin
poets where the chastity of the Sabine women is highly spoken of ; for
instance see Hor. Epod. 2. 40. 4.; but surely there is no necessity for
altering the present lection when we find in Livy 1. 8. “disciplina
tetrica ac tristis veterum Sabinorum, quo ρεπεν-ε nullum quondam in-
corruptius fuit.”

300. Praeterea, dte. “ Besides, though bounteous Nature with liberal
hand should give him a chaste disposition, and a cheek that glows with
the blush of modesty,” this latter expression was in Greek τὸ 75quoe-
τῆς ἀρετῆς.-Ρι“ορθι·1γ speaking, beniyna applies to natura, and larya to
manu.

324. Quid profuit immo, “ well, what did his solemn resolution avail
Hippolytus—what Bellerophon ?” propositum, his resolution to lead a
chaste life. His step-mother Phaedra endeavoured to seduce Hippoly-
tus, but ineffectually. She then in a paroxysm of rage accused him to
his father Theseus, in consequence of whose curse he was thrown from
his chariot and killed—Bellerophon was son of Glaucus. He rejected
the criminal advances of Sthenoboea the wife of his host Praetus king
of Argos. In consequence of his coldness she accused him to her hus·
band, who found means to get him much persecuted. These stories seem
to be founded on that of Joseph and Potiphar's wife ; Gen. xxxix. 7.

326. Erubuit, (stc, “Why truly the one (Phaedra) reddened at the
repulse as though scorned, also Sthenoboea took fire no less than the
Cretan, and both roused themselves to action,’' literally, ‘⁴ lashed
themselves into fury‚’' a metaphor from a lion.——H‹t¹c. This word is
singularly employed here, inasmuch as there is no previous mention of
Phaedra. Ruperti thinks there is an error in the text, and conjectures
the proper reading to be, Erubuit uum Phoedra, infastidita repulsa.
In the translation of the line which I have given, 1 have taken repulsa
as a noun, it may, however, with equal propriety be considered as a
participle in the nominative. Sthenoboea is called Antea in Homer. ll.
ζ’ 160.—C'ressa. Phaedra was daughter of Minos king of Crete and his
wife Pasiphae.

328. Soevissima, “ most relentless.''

329. Quum stimulo-³, &c. “ When sear of shame supplies incentivos
to her resentment,'’ i. e. “adds fuel to her hate,” properly a meta-
phor from goading oxea—Eligam ake. “Tell nm, what advice do you
