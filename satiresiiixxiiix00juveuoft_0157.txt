103. His, “ such perjuries as these,'’ scil. such as are not committed
out of contempt for the deity, but for the perjurer’s personal benefit.
Or his may be “faults like these,” (scil. delictis) namely perjuries.
The speaker thinks that as perjuries‚ though so numerous, are so seldoni
visited by outward punishment, the deity generally passes them over.

104. Diverso fato, “with different fate.'' Romulus, by sratricide,
gained a diadem ; others have been crucified for the perpetration of the
same crime. Or allusion may be made to Polycrates, the tyrant of Samos,
who was betrayed by his butler, and crucified, while the traitor received
his crown.

105. Crucem. The punishment of crucifixion was abolished by Con-
stantine, ΔΑ). 325.

106. Sic animum, (hc. “In such a way do they strengthen their
soul, when terrified with apprehension arising from some dreadful
crime.”

107. Tunc te, dvc. ‘¹ Then ho takes the lead of you, as you summon
him to the sacred shrines, nay, he is ready even to drag you thither.
(or, even if unassailed by you) and plague you heartily with vitupera-
tion.''--Ad sacra delubra vocantem, namely, that he may take his
oath.-— Ultro, the meaning which we have given to this word, viz..
‘⁴ even,'' seems best to suit the passage; it might also be rendered
“ contrary to expectation.’‘ It is the ablative of the old word ulter. ὅ
πέραν, and properly signifies ‘⁶ that which is beyond.’'

109. Nam quum, dxc. “ For when excessive hardihood attcnds a bad
cause, it is believed by many to be confidence in honesty.

110. Mimum ‹1in ille, ἁο. “ He acts such a farce as that run-away
slave, the buffoon of the facetious” or ‘⁴ ludicrous Catullus.”—Urb‹1ni‚
Ernesti gives the following definition of Urbanitas. “ Urbanitas is
that excellent quality of the mind and disposition, whereby, as men that
received a liberal education in a city, we can pronounce our judgment
on all matters with elegance, and are led not to say or do anything out
of place or absurd, but with an appearance of grace and freedom. This
urbanitas pervades our whole conduct, life, language, and manners
Hence urbanus signifies “ elegant” in every judgment, word and deed.
and is opposed to imperitus or absonus, as ἀστεῖος to ἀμαθὴς among the
Stoics. Then it signified one who lived constantly at Rome, either do-
ing nothing, or pleading in the forum, ἁο. From this it came to mean
‘¹ facetious‚'' ‘⁶ witty,⁷' as people were wont to become who lived in the
city with little or nothing to employ them; whence at length it was
used to express scurra, “a buffoon.”—Catulli. This is not Valerius
Catullus the poet, but Lutatius Catullus, who wrote a species of play
called “ the Phasma’' or “ Spectre,” in which there was the character
of a buffoon, who ran away from his master, after having cheated him,
and then provoked him, that he might be brought to swear himself off,
cheerfully proposing thus to be perjured.

112. Ut Stentora, dxc. ‘⁴ So loudly that you could well outdo Sten-
tor.'' Στὲντοςα χαλκιόφωνον, ὃς ‘Aaou αὐδήσασχ’, ὅσον ἄλλοι πεντήκοντα.

114. Jupiter, Ζεύς δ’ρκιος οι· δ’ςκω» ταμίας, the avenger of perjury is
here meant.

115. Vel marmoreus, dxc. “ Even though thou art of marble οι· of
brass.’' A sarcasm on the stupidity of men in worshipping marble and
