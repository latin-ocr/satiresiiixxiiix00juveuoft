Is order to form a proper judgment on the subject which we have now
to consider, the age in which each poet lived. also the manners and pur·
suits which then prevailed, should be particularly regarded. For no
species of composition was more the offspring of time and circumstance
than Satire, which thence derives its subjects, pith, and complexion-
Resides, the genius, education‚ and mode of life peculiar to each writer
should be minntely observed.

We shall, in the first place, say a few words about Lucilius separately.
This writer lived from the time of the siege of Carthage to the com·
mencement of the fifth consulate of Marius (in which the Cimbri and
Teutones were subdued). During this period there was, as it were, a
struggle between the old and new manners, between virtue and vice ; but
the former was yet openly commended by many. It is true that num—
bers had begun to be infected with the corrupting luxury which had been
imported from Asia, Greece, and Macedonia; but there were not want-

cious visitants. Freedom, both in speaking and writing, had not yet been
abolished by law, nor was much consideration shown to birth and rank.
Morem-er, the Romans, having gained some refinement from the study
of Menander’s productions and those of the other Greek authors, were
gradually divesting themselves of that harsh rusticity of wit and manner
which was so characteristic of them, and had already begun to model
their language after the Greek. Lucilius was on the most intimate
terms of friendship with the younger Scipio Africanus, Laelius, and
other distinguished personages—relying on whom for support, he lashed
the vicious, even by name, with impunity. He has shown in his writings
much of the old Roman humour, coupled with the keen irony which he
drew from the Greek comedians. His style is rough, and Greek is
interspersed throughout the poems; but his verses are more polished
than those of Ennius, though not so much as those composed by the
writers of the Augustan era.

The age of Horace differed in all respects from that of Lucilius. 'I'he
luxury, avarice, and other evils, which foreign wealth had carried to
