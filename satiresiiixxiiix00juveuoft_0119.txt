sunu: x. 73

gain—the attention which they now show him, will, as they judge, make
him give them some of his hoarded wealth. The line casts a reflection
as well upon the stingy patrous, as on the mercenary clients.—Dcfossu,
according to some, refers to the clients who strive to gain the friend-
ship of the rich, only to collect doles, and fill ‘⁶ their own'' pockets
therewith.

47. T unc quoque, “ even in those days,'’ when there was the greatest
simplicity of manners, and no extrav-agant display of empty pomp.—
Ῑηυέηἱί, scil Democritus, Transl. “he found something to laugh at
1ιι 311 his meetings with men3 and his wisdom pioves that the most
eminent men, even those who will furnish magnificent patterns of con-
duct, may be produced ιιι the native land of mutton- heads, and beneath
a foggy atmosphere! ’—Abdera in Thrace was celebrated for the stu-
pidity of its inhabitants. It was called‘ ‘the land of bell-wethers‚”
vervecum, as Boeotia was designated ⁴‘ the land of hogs.'¹ Comp. Hor.
Epist. 2. 1. 244.—Boeotum in crasso jurares ae're natum.

53. Mandaret laqueum, “ would hand,'’ “ present a halter,’' equivalent
to our phrase bid her “ go, be hanged !'' Comp. ὅςέξας τᾶν βρόχον, Luc.
Tim—Mediumque ostenderet unyucm, another great instance of his
contempt for fortune, for the “middle finger’' was called infamis by
Persius, and impudicus by Martial. This use of unquis in the sense of
diyitus could not be extended to prose.

54. Eryo. “ So then,'' “ consequently;” or, because few can distin-
guish the vera bona from their opposite (vid. 2.)-Pernici0sa, particu-
larly opes and divitica (24), which appear to us to be bona, and are
therefore solicited.

55. Fas. This word offends Ruperti, who says that it seems foreign
to the passage, and that he is inclined to believe that mos should be
substituted in the text. It is rather strange that this distinguished scholar
was not aware that fas is, in many passages of the classical authors,
to be translated in the sense of mos. Thus, Virg. Georg. 1. 126. “ Ne
siynare quidem aut partiri limite campum Fas erat,” where Heyne
remarks, “ Fas. i. e. 5011111511, sonu-mi, ut soepe.” The synonymous
Greek term θίμις 15 3150 to be found in the same sense, and it is sur·
prising that the Lexicons have overlooked it. In the κατάπλους of
Lucian, Mercury says to one of the characters, “ Micyllus, are you
uttering no sounds of grief3'’ καὶ μὴν οὗ θέμις ἀδακρυτὶ διαπλεῦσαί τινα,
“ And yet it is not customary for any person to go across, unless in
tears.‘' Now Merum-y, in his next speech, gives plainly a reason why
he should weep—{um κᾶν funeb* τι πρὸς τὲ ἔθος havingan, “ however do
send forth some few groans at least for custom's sake.'' Translate
therefore the present passage “for the attainment of which it is cus-
tomary to cover with wax the knees of the gods.'’—-Inccrare (immeo,
γίζεσθαι). The ancients used to write their vows to the gods on a
waxen tablet, and fasten it with wax to the image of the deity, espe-
cially to the knees. When they gained the object of their desires, they
took away the paper, tore it, and brought to the altars whatever they
had promised. Of that which is quite precarious, and for which they
had thus to solicit the divine interserence, the phrase is used θεῶν ἰν
γούνασι κεῖται, the knees being the seat of mercy.

56. Quosdam, (ito. Many persons pray for high dignities as though a
verum bonum ‚· but they often bring ruin upon the successful aspirants.
Quosdam, proecipat. 4¹0. power which is exposed to (i. e. which is liable
to excite) great envy causes the rapid fall of some.”

57. Honorum paqlna, lit. “page of dignities,'' i. e. a list of honours
