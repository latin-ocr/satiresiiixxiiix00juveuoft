128 NOTES os JUV'ENAL.

61. Arida aranea, ‘¹ the spider that loves a dry corner‚” Rup. or
simply ‘¹ attenuated‚’' “ meagre,” but the first seems preferable, as we
have no reason assigned for its being dried up or dead.

62. Hic leve, dxc. “ Let one scour the polished plate and another the
embossed vessels.”——Aspera is equivalent here to the Greek ἅναίγλνφα.

63. Vox domini, dvc. ‘¹ Loudly blusters the voice of the master, as
he urges his slaves and holds the rod.'’

64. Trepidas. “ You are in a fiurry,” “ you anxiously bestii· your-
self.”

65. Atria, “ the entrance hall.’' The atrium was called ιιῦλὺ by the
Greeks, and by virgil (AEn. 3. 354), also μεσαύλον, περίστυλον attestemur.
Two derivations are given by the ancient writers. Festus and Varro
refer it to the same origin: “ab Atrioe populis, a quibis atriorum
exempla desumpta fuerunt ,·’' but Servius derives the term from ater,
“ propter santum qui esse solebat in atriis.'' Atrium is used in a dis-
tinctive‚ as well as collective, sense, to designate a particular part in
the private houses of the Romans, and also a class of public buildings,
so called from their general resemblance in construction to the atrium
of a private house. There is a distinction between cztn'um and area ,-
the former being an open area surrounded by a colonnade, while the
latter had no such ornament attached to it. The Atrium of a house
was a large apartment roofed over, with the exception of an opening 'iu
the centre, called compluvium, towards which the roos sloped, so as to
throw the rain-water into a cistern in the floor, termed impluvium,
which was frequently ornamented with statues, columns, and other
works of art The word impluvium, however, is also employed to
denote the aperture in the roos. The atrium was the most important
room in the house, and among the wealthy was usually fitted up with
much splendour and magnificence (comp. Hor. Od. 3. 1, 46). It ap-
pears oriyinally to have been the only sitting-roem in the house, and to
have served also as a kitchen ; and it probably continued to do so among
the lower and middle classes. In the houses of the wealthy, however,
it was distinct from the private apartments, and was used as a recep-
tion-room where the patron received his clients; and the great and
noble, the numerous visitors who were accustomed to call every
morning to pay their respects or solicit favours. But though the
atrium does not appear to have been used by the wealthy as a sitting-
room for the family3 it still continued to be employed for many pur-
poses. which it had originally served. Thus the nuptia} couch was
placed in the aerium opposite thc door (in aum, Hor. Ep. 1. 1. 87),
and also the instrumenta and materials for spinning and wearing, which
were formerly carried on by the women of the family in this room.
Here also the images of their ancestors were placed (J ur. 8, 19), and
the focus, or fire-place, which possessed a sacred character, being de-
dicated to the Lares of each family.

66. Nc perfusa, «ize. ¹· That the por-ch should not bc bespattered with
mire.'' Porticus (σι-σαί) was a walk covered with a roos. which was
supported by columns. at least on one side. The Greeks (from whom
the Romans imbibed their fondness for them) had porticoes attached
to temples and other public buildings, and also they built some inde-
pendent of any other ediflcc. As luxuries among thc Romans were
carried to a greater extent in everything than in Greece, the wealthy
had their private porticoes. sometimes in the city itself, and sometime·
in their country-scats.—Eae tamen uno, the.. ‘⁴ and yet one young slave
