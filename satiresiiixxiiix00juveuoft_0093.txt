142. Jffyerum is not from ν51191011 “a yoke‚” but rather from jffqis,
from its being “ continued’' in space. The jzcyer was 240 feet long by
120 broad. It was the double of the “ Actus Quadratus,'' and from this
circumstance, according to some writers, 11 derived its name. The
jaqerum was the common measure of land among the Romans. Two
juycra formed an haeredium, a hundred hoeredia, a centuria, and four
centuriae a saltat. These divisions were derived from the original
assignment of lauded property, in which two juyera were given to each
citizen as heritable property—Quam malm, dxc. “ What kind of a.
table does he keep ?”—Par0psis (παροψὶς) “a dish.’'

144. Tantum habet et fidei, &ce—‘⁶ A man's credit is proportioned
to the amount of the coins in his money-chest.’'— Tantum fidei habet,
so the Greeks said πίστιν ἔχει. The primary signification offides seems
to have been “the grounds of confidence,” that quality in a person
which raises confidence.—Jures licet, dxc. “ Though a person [scil. any
poor man] were to swear by the altars of the Cabiri, and those of our
own divinities; yet the poor fellow is believed to have no respect for the
bolts of heaven, and even for the deities themselves, while the latter
take no notice of his misconduct.” The poor person being urged by
want was believed to be more easily led to perjure himself, and to dread
the wrath of heaven less than the wealthy; for in the ease of the for-
mer, present calamity would have greater influence than apprehension
for the future. The gods, also, were supposed to be more easily pre-
vailed on to forgive him, on the grounds of his being forced to it by
necessity, rather than instigated by depravity of heart. Bahrdt thinks
that the meaning of the poet is that the gods (10 1101 care about persons
of a low degree offering them injnry: but that when a rich man offends
them by perjury, their jealousy (Nemesis) and wrath are roused.—-

the north of the AEgean, is now called Samandrachi ; the Roman pe-
nates came originally from this island.--¹‘ The Samothracian divinities‚”
or “ Cabiri” were, according to most writers, four in number, whose
names were Axier0s‚ Axiochersus, Axiochersa, and Casmilus. They
were held in great veneration at Thebes and Lemnos, but most parti-
cularly in the islands of Samothrace and Imbros. Creuzer traces their
worship, in the first instance, 10 1119 Phoenicians, and makes them iden-
tical with the Pataeci or Pataeci of these people. He next finds traces
of these same Cabiri in Upper Asia, in the name of the Pontio city of
Cabiri, in the Mesopotamian Carrae ; and in 1119 Chaldean river Chobar
or Chaboras. He discovers also in Malta, among the remains of Punic
preserved in the vulgar dialect of the island, some traces of the name
Cabiri in the word Qbir or Kibir, which seems to designate an ancient
pagan divinity, and is now taken to denote “ the devil.'’ Other writers
believe traces of the Cabiri to exist in Persia, and refer to the Gaba-
rini, “ strong men,'’ whom the essential ideas of metallurgy and arms
would seem naturally 1ο assimilare, either to the robust forgemen of
Vulcan, or to the armcd priests of Phrygia, Crete, and different parts
of Greece. Others have recourse to the mythology of India, and find
the root of the word in the Hindoo Cuvera. But the best etymology
is that which makes the appellation of those deities a Phoenician one,
