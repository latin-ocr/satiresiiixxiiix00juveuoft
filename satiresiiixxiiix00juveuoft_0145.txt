NOTES ΟΝ SATIRE XIII.

ARGUMENT.

CALvtxns had left a sum of money in the hands of a confidential per-
son; no uncommon thing in those days, as there were then no public
banks. This man, when he came to re-demand it, foreswore the depo-
sit—15 se< .

The utufgst indignation and fury, are expressed by Calvinus at this
breach of trust, 11-15, His friend Juvenal endeavours to soothe and
comfort him under his loss—7 seqq.

The topics of consolation which the poet employs are these. That
the fortune of Calvinus was so considerable that the loss could be easily
borne: 7 seqq. 13—16. and that such acts of dishonesty were nothing
extraordinary, amid the general depravity of the times, when a man of
strict integrity would be regarded as a prodigy: 16—74. 120-173,
This universal corruption was owing, in J uvenal’s opinion, to the ab·
surd notions entertained respecting the deities‚ from the opinions of the
avowed atheist, to those of the practical infidel: 75—119. He pro-
ceeds to deprecate revenge‚ as no reparation of harm received, and as
unworthy of a man and a philosopher: 174—192. to represent the
stings of a guilty conscience, and the superstitious sears of the guilty,
as an infinitely greater punishment than any other: 192-235. and to
state, that if the wicked are left to themselves, they add crime to
crime, till the measure of their iniquities is full, when vengeance and
retribution infallibly oven-take them.—236—-249.

Juvenal is here almost a christiam for though his ignorance of “that
light which was to come into the world,'’ did not enable him to number
among the dreadful consequences of impenitent guilt, the certain pun-
ishment of life to come; yet on every other topic that can alarm or
terrify the sinner, he is energetic and awful beyond example. Perhaps
the horrors ot a troubled conscience were never depicted with such
impressive solemnity as in this satire.—192—198, 210—239.

Bishop Burnet (as we before stated) recommended the tenth satire
to his clergy, in his “ Pastoral Letters⁷’ ι the present is not, indeed, so
poetic, so servid, so majestical‚ as that; but, on the other hand, it en-
ters more into the common business of lise. All cannot be statesmen
and kings: but all may be injured by treachery, and all have need to
be reminded that guilt sometimes finds its punishment, even on this side
the grave !

precedent, gives unpleasant sensations even to the perpetrator.” Some
editions have malum, committit exemplo. But Ruperti remarks that in
this case the perpetrator would commit a crime ‘⁴ after'’ some precedent,
