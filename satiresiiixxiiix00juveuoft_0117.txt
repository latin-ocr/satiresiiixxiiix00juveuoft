SATIRE x. '71

tium, above the Pontiae Marshes. Augustus preferred this wine to all
others.—Ardebit, may be perhaps better rendered ‘⁴ will glow,” alluding
to its heat and strength.

28. Jamne iyitur laudas, (bc. There are two methods of rendering
this sentence, (1) “ Dost thou, nOW, appi-ove of,’' or “ rate highly that
at which one of the wise men used to laugh,'' dc? (2) “ Dost thou not
now appi-ove of this, namely, that one of the wise men, &c.? According
to the first method, quod is a relative referring to abundance and arro-
gant display of wealth.—Aller‚ scil. Democritus, a celebrated philosopher
of Abdera. It is said that hc continually laughed at the follies and
vanity of mankind, who distract themselves with care, and are at once
a prey to hope and anxiety. He was a man of sublime genius, and
penetrating judgment, and by a long course of study and observation,
became an eminent master of speculative and physical science. Among
his fellow-citizens he obtained the title of Γελασῖνος or “the derider.''
He died in the 109th year of his age, B. c. 361.

30. Contrarias auctor, ‘⁴ an‚adviser of a different line of conduct,''
scil. Heraclitus of Ephesus, who flourished about 13.c. 503 (Clinton).
He was later than Pythagoras, Xenophanes, and Hecataeus. Although
it is usual to call him “ the crying philosopher,'’ from his supposed cus-
tom of shedding tears at the vices of mankind, yet the fact of his having
done so is not by any means established. Perhaps the story arose from
his austere and sullen temper, whence he is called T enebrosus. His
death, according to Aristone, happened at the age of sixty.

31. Sed facilis, dxc. “ But the censure of a harsh laugh is easy for
any one ; the matter for wonder is how the eyes of the latter [philoso-
pher] could get sufficient moisture,” i. c. it is easy to laugh, but the
vices of the age were so numerous that it is wonderful to think how a
man could get moisture enough to supply tears.—Oaclzinni, καγχασ-
ιιοῦ.-Εἰ9ἰάί; although this word must be taken in construction with
cachinni, its force goes with censura.

33. Pulmonem ayitare, “to shake his sides,'’ Pulmo is from πλεύ-
μων, for πνεύμων·

34. Quanquam, dvc. i. e. although in Democritus’ time, aud “in those
cities’' where he resided, scil. Abdera, and other towns of Thrace, there
was no such vain and empty pomp and external grandeur as we have in
Rome.

35. Praetexta, this word is properly the participle of praetexo, and
signifies ‘⁴ bordered,” or ‘⁴ fringed ;'' the expression is therefore ellipti-
cal, the full phrase being toyu purpura prcetexta, and this we find in
Livy. It is often, however, used alone to signify ‘¹ the senatorial gown,”
——see note on line 99.— T rabeae ‚· these were splendid robes of state,
worn by KingS, by Knights‚ by Augurs, and by Consuls. They had a
broad border and horizontal stripes of purple ; hence probably the word
is from trabs “ a beam.” Servius mentions three kinds of trabeae ,· one
wholly of purple, which was sacred to the gods; another of purple and
white, and another of purple which belonged to Augurs. The purple
and white was a royal robe, and is assigned to the Latin and early
Roman Kings, especially to Ron1u1us.—Fasces. These were rods bound
in the form of a bundle‚ and containing an axe (securis) in the middle,
the iron of which projected from them. They were carried by lictors
before the superior magistrates of Rome. P. Valerius Publicola or-
dained that the secures should be removed from the fascea—Lectica,
Greek κλίνη, κλινίδιον, φορεῖον· For the different kinds of leccicoe the
reader is referred to “ Smith’s Dictionary of Greek and Roman Anti-
