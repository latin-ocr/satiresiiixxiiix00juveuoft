144 NoTEs ox jUVENAL.

eris-sasai “33²² αὔρας ) is said by the Greek grammarians to have been a
pole or board on which fowls roosted. Hence in the Roman games it
is said by many to mean a machine to which the petauristoe vaulted or
bounded up with such agility as to resemble a fowl’s flight. If this be
correct, the words of the text will be rendered, “ persons flinging them-
selves actively οη the petaurum.’' The more correct view, however,
is, that it was a board moving up and down, with a person at each end,
and supported in the middle, something like our see·saw; only it ap-
pears to have been much longer, and consequently went to a greater
height, than is common amongst us. In this case translate the words,
“ tost up and down on the petaurum.” Others say that the petam-um
was a small hoop, through which the petauristoe jumped, and then
alighted on their feet. Others again maintain that it resembled “ the
Up and Down‚” a large wheel revolving perpendicularly with seatS,
somewhat like those of a cabriolet, appended to its circumference3
which we sometimes see at fairs. From all this it would seem that
there were various feats of agility designated by the word.

266. Quique, (hc. “ And he who is wont to descend (“ walk along“)
the tight rope.’' The funambulus, αχοιηβῶτης, καλοβάτης, σχοινσβάτης,
is meant. For quique we have quippe in Ruperti's second Edition
(Lips. 1819), but it must be a typographical error, as the word is
neither mentioned in his Var. lectt„ nor in his Index.

267. Quam ιιι, scil. oblectas animum-Coryci& “ Cretan,'' for
Corycus or Corjjcum was a town and mountain of Crete,—a country
whose inhabitants were much engaged in merchandise. So say
Ruperti and others; but Britannicus and several commentators refer
the epithet to Corycus a town and harbour of Cilicia Campestris,-
and, as the Cilicians were great rovers and pirates, the poet would
convey the insinuation, that the avaricious inan who recklcssly roams
everywhere over the sea in pursuit of wealth, is little better than a
rover.

268. Coro, dte. ‘¹ Ever liable to be destroyed by the north-west and
south wind.'’—Coro, see 10, 180. Corus is not the same as the Greek
Zephyrus: the latter was the ¹west wind, and corresponds with the Latin
Favonius.--Auster, Νότος.

269. Perditus, dcc. ‘⁸ 'she abandoned and wretched purchaser of fetid
bales,'‘ or rather ‘¹ of strong-scented bales ;'’ sor olEre means ⁴* to sinell
strongly,” whether of perfuines or of noisome objects. lt is probabit:
that the allusion is to aromata, which the avarus purchased iu distant
Countries. However, we may render the word ⁴* fetid.’' ‘⁴ odious‚‘'
explaining it as referring to tlte judyment of llic poet, which despises
such luxuries and superfiuities as men risked their lives to procuro in
order to amass rapid foi-tunes. This is Dr Stocker's opinion. So also
in Hor. Epis. 1, 14, 21, uncta popina is used analogously, as express-
ing, namely, the poet's own feeling. see M·Caul·s note.

270. Antiquoe Cretae. Countries and cities prided themselves, no less
than fainilies, on their antiquity.—Pinyuc Passum advexisse. ““ to have
imported rich raisin-wine.’' This was made from grapes dried in the
sun. until they had lost half their weight‚ or they were plunged into
boiling oil, which produced a similar effect. or the bunches after they
