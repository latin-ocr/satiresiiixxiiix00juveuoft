tude, puts more to death [scil. than eloquence or bodily powers], and so
does an income which exceeds all inheritances, by as much as the
whale of the British sea exceeds the dolphin in its diinensions.”-l3.
Stranyulat, i. e. either is the cause of death to its possessor by despots
and robbers, or “ tortures,'’ scil. by the “ anxiety” with which they
guard it; or, perhaps “ chokes‚’' with reference to Midas—14. Balaena:
small whales sometimes penetratcd into the Mediterranean; but Pliny
informs us that the largest were found in the Indian ocean. In the con-
struction of this sentence, tanto is to be supplied after exsuperans.

16. Lonyinus, ὣς. “ An entire cohort surrounded Longinus, and the
extensive gardens of the over-wealthy Seneca, and beset the august
mansion of the Laterani.’'—Lonyinum. Burman, on Propert. l. 1. 24.
says, “ the ancients like to employ one verb, though they make mention
of two things which are distinct and different ; and to leave out the
other verb, which is to be supplied from the sense ; thus in Juvenal 10,
16. the construction is Lonyimtm mori coegit, et Senecoe hortos clau·
sit? on which Ruperti makes the following remarks: “ I am indeed
persectly aware that often the Greek and Roman writers join one verb
to two or more members, although its full signification can be referred
only to one member, but then from that verb a kindred meaning, and
not an essentially different and dissimilar one, is to be taken and trans-
ferred [to the other member or members].'’ Otherwise Lonyinum is
put for Lonqini domum. Ruperti conjectures the proper reading to be
Lonyini et.—Senecoe hortos clausit. The Longinus here mentioned
was Caius Cassius Longinus, a famous lawyer, and governor of Syria,
banished by Nero, but recalled by Vespasian. There was another C.
Cassius Longinus whom Nero put to death.— Senecoe. Lucius Annaeus
Seneca was born about 13.c. 6, and was early distinguished by his ex-
traordinary talents. The life of this singular man has been the subject
of much conflicting testimony; most critics maintaining that he was a
man of great integrity, while others assert, with at least equal firmness,
that he was a most abandoned character. Among the latter class of
critics is Gifford, who, in the notes to his translation of Juvenal, has
spoken of Seneca with a virulence altogether peculiar. Without enter-
ing into a discussion upon this point, we may observe in the words of
Anthou, that ‘⁶ a candid judge, who considers the virtuous sentiments
with which his writings abound, the temperate and abstemious life
which he led in the midst of a luxurious court, and the fortitude with
which he met his fate, will not hastily pronounce him to be guilty of
adultery on the evidence of the infamous Messalina, or conclude his
wealth to have been the reward of a servile compliance with the base
passions of his prince.” Even ‘⁶ Seneca's tragedies,'’ which we hear
spoken of so contemptuously as compositions, are by the best judges
not attributed to him, but to writers in the reign of Trajan.-—17. Clau-
sit. Adopting Ruperti's opinion respecting the sentence before us, we
must have recourse to the figure zeugma in this verb‚—thus‚ when taken
