112 NOTES ON JUVENAL.

upon thy blazing altar the holy incense, and the severed liver of a calf,
and the white caui of a pig 2” The ancients expected blessings from
their deities out of gratitude for vows and oblations, and not from a
feeling of benevolence. And they took good care, also, in their prayers
to remind the gods of all their costly offerings to them—Carbone, i. e.
the altar on which the coals were placed—Pia, because it testifies
piety towards heaven.— Scotum, “ cut out'' from the inside of the calf ;
or, as some explain, “ cut up‚” into small pieces that it might be burned
more easily—Alba, either “white’' from the quantity of fat, or the
phrase may mean “the cau] of a white pig.’'—Omcntum properly de—
noted the thin membrane which enfolds the intestines, then it signified
the bowels‚ and lastly‘ ‘the fat,” as, perhaPS, in the present passage,
and as κνίσση or ἳημδς ln Hom. Il.1, 460.

118. Ut video, dc. “As far as Ι see, no differenee IS to be observ ed
between,'’ dxc. Vagellius was a very great fool, but nevertheless had
the honour of a statue. The ancient Scholium on the passage is “ qui.
ut vos, stultissimus accepit statuam.” Perhaps the person intended is
Vagellius of Mutina, a bombastic declaimer, who is stated to hare been·
blessed with a cor mulinum in xvi. 23. Many read Bathylli, not Ba-
thyllus the pantomimist, but a youth of Samos, by whose beauty
Anacreon and Polycrates were captivated‚ and whose statue was dedi-
cated by the latter, in the temple of Juno, at Samos—Some MSS.
have Batili which approaches to the Greek βάταλος, a personal name,
but applied by reason of the individual’s effeminacy, to every mean and
imbecile character.

120. Accipe, ὥσ. “ IIear now (Calvinus) what consolation on the
other hand a person can offer, one too who h'as read neither the Cynics,
nor the tenets of the Stoic who differs from the Cynics merely in the
fashion of a tunic: one who does not venerate Epicurus, enjoying in
cheerful content the plants of a small garden.’' The consolation, says
Juvenal, that I will give you is taken from a common sense view of
your case, nor is there any need of philosophical arguments to comfort
you for the inconsiderable loss of ten sestertia.

122. :l cynicis tunica distantia. Antisthenes was the founder of
the Cynic sect, and Zeno of the Stoic, which was in fact but a branch
of the Cynic‚—as the two agreed for the most part in point of morals,
the chief differencc between them in morality being. that the Cynics
disdained the cultivation of nature, the Stoics affected to rise above it.
The latter sect received its name from στοὰ “the Porch.'' where Zeno
kept his school. In their dress the two sects differed. Both used the
pallium, but underneath this the Stoics wore a tunic. the Cynics only
waistcoats, whence the latter were called ἁχίφωνε,·.-Ερίτιινυε was born
at Gargettus in Attica, and diod. n.e. 270. in his seventy-second year.
According to him the summum honum was that pleasure which arises
from the consciousncss os virtue. Four charges are brought against
this philosopher; 1. that he superseded all religious principles by re-
mor-ing the gods from the care and control of the world ; 2. that if he
acknowledged their existence. it was only in conformity to popular pre-
judice. since, according to his system. nothing exists in nature but
material atonis : 3. he discovered great insolenee in the disi-espect with
which he treated the mcmory of former philosophers. and the characters
and persons of his contemporaries; 4. both he and his disciples were
addicted to the grossest sensuality. Zeno, Cicero. Plutarch, Galen,
and a long train of christian Fathcrs moro or less confirm these accu-
sations. The first charge certainly admits os no refutation, hut with
