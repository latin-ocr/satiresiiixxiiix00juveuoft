40 nomas oN JUVENAL.

for their luxurious and Iicentious style of life. Valesius punctuated the
passage thus “Quamvis quota portio soecis Achaeoe jampridem Syrus
in Tiberim defluxit Orontes,'’ with this meaning, ‘⁴ Quamvis Syri
Antiochenses, qui parva Graecorum sunt portio, jam pridem Romam
civibus et vitiis suis impleverunt.'’—63. Cum tibicine chordas obliquas,
lit. ‘¹ the slanting strings together with the flate-player,'’ i. e. both stringed
and wind instruments. Vossius maintains that the whole phrase refers
only to one kind of instrument, soil. the τλαγιιιύλος, i. e. obliqua tibia, called
obliqua because it requires those who play it to hold the head to one side,
chordoe and fides, he says, are used not only in reference to stringed instru-
ments (ἰγχόρδαι or ἰιτατιίι), but also to flutes, (tibiae), and, m'ce versci,
cithara is used for tibioe, and αὐλισμδς for κιθαρῳδία. According to this
view the clause must be translated, “ the war-mmmm flutes together with .
the performer.” Spanheim‚ however, differs from Vossius on this point,
‘¹ Those obliqueflutes of the ancients, or playiauli, are familiar enough,
and moreover the tibioe of the Phoenicians or Syrians, (who are con-
founded by the Latin and Greek writers) which were called γίγγροι or
γίγγςαι, and Sarranae or δἐι-ταντα, i. e. “ Syrian.'’ But that both
scrinyed ancl wind instruments are mentioned here as being introduced
by the Syrians into the city (see Hor. Epod. 9, 5. where he speaks of
the two playing together) appears likely from the fact that both the
playiaulus and the straiylzt flate, were held to be the invention of the
Phryyians, and hence the performers on them (tibicinae) were termed
Plzryyii and Berecyntlzii ,· and also that most of those stringed instru-
ments of the ancients were brought from Syria and Phenicia, whence
also they were called by foreign names, nabla, barbitos, mciyd'dis, psal-
terium, εαηιόῦοα, cithera (5522). Livy (39. 6;) where he tells us of

the origin of luxury in Rome, namely, that it was brought thither by
the army from Asia, does not mention tibica or tibicines in any way
whatever, but says, “ tum psaltrioe sambucistrioeque et convivialia lu-
dionum oblectamenta addita epulisss' The Sambuca was a triangular
harp, with strings of unequal dimensions: the latera and cornua (aenxu'ae
and nieuw) of the lyre or harp, and other stringed instruments of that
kind were obliqua.’'

64. Gentilia tympana “ national tambourines.'’ The τύμπανον or—aes

piece of wood excavated, and covered with a skin which was beaten
with the hand, generally by girls5 it. was very common in the east
(hence yentilia). and was brought thence to Spain, where it was em-
ployed on sestal occasions, (never in wars) and was made of different
shapes ; sor instance. that. which was used in the rites of Bacchus and
Cybele was shaped like a sieve.

65. Proslarc, “to stand for hire.'' “to prostitute themselves.”—
Circum. Of the several Circuses at Rome the Maximus is here meant,
which was first built by Tarquinius Priscus. Its extent in after times
was three furlongs long, and one broad. It was called Circus either be-
cause the spectators ⁸· stood round'' to see the games, or because the pro-
cessions and races went round it in a circle. 'l'he object of its first
and temporat)- erection was to celebrate the conquest of Apiola from
the Latius. and its site was in the Marcian valley between the Palatino
and Aventino hius.
