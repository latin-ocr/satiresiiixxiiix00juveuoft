as well as a king should swallow before his food ;'’ for if a father rear his
children badly, he has as much to dread from them, as a tyrant from

Arca, see 3, 'IL—Fiscus. The following is Savigny’s account of the
origin and meaning of this term :—In the republican period, the state.
was designated by the term AErarium, in so far as it was view-ed
with respect to its rights of property, which ultimately resolved

provinces between the senate, as the representative of the old republic.
and the Caesar ; and there was consequently a division of the most im-
portant branches of public income and expenditure. The property of
the senate retained the name of “Erarium, and that of the Caesar. as
such, received the name of Fiscus. Tho private property of the Caesar
was quite distinct from that of the Fiscus. The word Fiscus signified
“a wicker-basket.'‘ or “pannier,’' in which the Romans were accus·

of the imperial Fiscus soon led to the practice of appropriating the
name to that property which tho Caesar claimed as Coesar, and the
word Fiscus, without any adjunct. was used in this sense (res fisci est.
Juv. 4. 54). Ultimately the word came to signisy generally ‘¹ the pro-
perty of the state,'' the Coesar having concontrated in himself all the
sovereign power. and thus tho word finally had the same signification as
AErarium in tho republican period—F iscus is from iaxta-We have
