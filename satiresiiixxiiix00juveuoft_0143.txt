SATIRE x. 97

oculis, thus, “is hurried off (scil. to destruction) doomed to be destroyed
by the eyes of Messalina.” Others erroneously translate “to be de-
stroyed before the eyes of Messalina.''

333. Par-ato F lamedlo, “ with bridal veil prepared.”

334. Tyriusque, dic. “ And in the gardens a marriage-conch over-
spread with purple is openly placed, and, after the ancient fashion, a
dowry will be given, namely ten hundred thousand sesterces‚’' Hortis,
scil. of Lucullus, a place of public resort.

336. Siynatoribus. Those who signed the papers relative to the
dowry, ἀεὶ. Auspex. No important step was taken by the Romans,
unless under the sanction of the auspices. Hence they were always in
attendance on marriage ceremonies.

337. Haec tu, ἀο. “ Didst thou [Silius] really imagine that these
proceedings were secret, and entrusted to but few? She won’t marry
unless in regular form,'' scil. with the auspeoe, the siynatores, dxc.
Everything in this ceremony proves that Messalina, in her mad passion,
wished all forms of the most sacred marriage (confarreatio) to be scru-
pulously observed, the dom-y, auspex, ὥρη all confirm this. Such a
marriage could only be broken by rites of the most horrible description.

338. Quid placeat, dic, «ke. ‘⁶ Tell me, then, your determination ; if
you don’t choose to obey her, you will be murdered before candles are
lighted,” i. e. if you do not submit to her wishes in being married pub-
licly, she will get you murdered before evening.—Lacernas‚ λυχναφιαν.

340. Si scelus, &c. “ Whereas if you do commit the crime, trifling
indeed will be the respite afforded you, [namely] until the matter, long
known to the city and community at large, reaches the ears of the Em-
perorff’

342. Dedecus, dte. ‘⁶ He (the Emperor) will be the last to know the
dishonour of his house.'’ Such was the infatuated stupidity of this
prince.

343. Sit tanti, &c. “ Let a few days longer duration of your life be
of such value in your eyes‚” as to induce you to comply with her de-
mands. For if you do comply you will live for a few days, until the
matter shall have become known to Claudius; whereas if you do not
comply you will be murdered this evening ; but, dxc„ see next note.

344. Quidquid, ihc. “ Whichever course you may consider the pre-
ferable and the easier one [it is all the same which you adopt, for] this
fair and radiant neck of yours must be presented to the steel,'' either
of Messalina or of Claudius. With the latter clause compare, Eurip.
ΗΕΘ. 544. παρέξω γὰρ δέρην εὐκαρδίως.

346, &c. The poet does not mean that all wishes of mankind should
be stopped, but they should be accommodated to the vastly superior power
which the deity possesses of knowing our wants, and estimating our
deficiencies.

349. Nam pro, Asc. “ For instead of what is agreeable, the Deity
will give us everything that is most suited for us,'’ There is a distinc-
tion between jucundus and yratus. Everything which is jucundum is
yratum, but not vice verse} : thus, medicine is yratum to a sick person,
but not jucundum.

350. Nos, dxc. ‘⁴ Carried away by the impetuosity of our passions,
and by blindin g and powerful desire, we pray for our marriage, and for
a prolific spouse ; but to them only [the deities] is it known of what
nature will be our children, of what nature our wise.”

355. Divina tomacula. “ The consecrated sausages.” The fornaculum,
from τέμοι or τίμια (τέμνω), was a sausage made of the lix-er aud other
