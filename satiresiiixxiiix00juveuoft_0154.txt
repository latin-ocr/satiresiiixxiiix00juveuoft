108 sorus οΝ JUVENAL.

tous event or miracle ς the libellis, in this case, are the Sibylline
books of Tarquin.

64. Eyreyium sanctumque virum, “ an eminently good aad pious
man.’'-Bimembri hoc monstrum, dic. ‘⁶ I esteem this extraordinary
phenomenon (scil. the virum) equal to a child with double limbs, or to
fishes found under the wondering plough, and to a mule with foa1.''—-
Bimembri may also be rendered “ half man and half beast‚'' as the
Centaurs (nubigenae bimembres), the Minotaur, ‹im—Miranti, this word
enhances the greatness of the prodigy3 the very plough wondered at it.
Other editions exhibit mirandis, agreeing with piscibus. Aehaintre
reads liranti, “forming the furrow.'' The reading ‘mirandis is objec-
tionable, “ non enim pisces sunt mirandi, sed mirandum est, quod sub
aratro inventi sunt‚” Ruperti. The hiatus after puero is to be re-
marked. Some insert jam after miranti to support the metm, but it
is not necessary, as our author has many instances of hiatus like the
present.—Foetae, it would be better to translate this “which has foaled.”
We may also obser-ve that the shortening of ο in verbs, as here in com-
paro, is contrary to Virgil’s usage.

67. Tamquam, (hc. Comp. Livy, 1. 31„ &c-

68. Examenve, (hc. “ Or as though a swarm of bees in a long cluster
(βοτςῦδον, Hom. 11. β’ 89.) had settled on the roof of a temple.'’ This
was esteomed a bad omen.

⁴39. Tamquam, dxc. “ As though a river fiowed into the ocean, with
its rolling waters of a strange appearance, and one that rushed furiously
with a torrent of milk.” As most commentators make qim-yitibus miris
refer to those rivers which were sabled to run with blood, these words
plainly cannot apply to the same river as that to which lactis vortice
:illudes It would be better therefore to read, with Jacobs, aut lactis.-
but would it not do as well to make torrens a substantive? for miris
Schraeder proposed niveis or Myris,- Jacobs conjectured rubris. We
may render mizi-s· “ portentous‚‘’ the whiteness and redness of streams
were owing to the soil over which they flowed being white, chalky, or
red. Grangaeus, however, thinks that miris yuryitibus expresses the
yreat violence of the waters, and not the colour.

71. Intercepta (esse), “ have been prevented from coming to your
hands.⁷’—Decem sestertia. ιἑζὲῖθ. 14. 7.

72. Bis centum (sestertia), ³21614. 11. S.

73. Arcana, “ secretly entrusted to him‚'’ given him without wit-
ness.'’—Majorem‚ &c “And what if a third lost a sum larger than
that, which the cavity of a capacious strong box had hardly contained3''

75. Tamsacilc el pronum cst. ‘⁶ so easy and ready it is.''

76. Si mortalis, dxc. “is a follow-mortal do not know that same.’'
So prone are mortals to despisc tho gods who are witnesses of all their
ιιυιίοηες if they can but hide them from tho eyes of mem—Adspice,
«e. “ see with what earnestness os tone he (your friend) denies (tho
deposit), what stoadiness or unblushing firmness there is in his studied,
01· ‹lisguised, look.”

'a' -1 Tarpeiaque sul-mina, “and by the thunderbolts of Capitoline

71). Martis frameam. “tho javelin of Mnrs.'' 'rho framea was a
