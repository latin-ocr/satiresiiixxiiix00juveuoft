 

SATIRE 111. 35

22. “ Nulla emolumenta laborum,‘’ “ since no advantage results from
strenuous exertions.’²—em0lumentum‚ from e and mola (μόλῃ) “ a mill?
is properly “ the profit got by grist.'’

23. Here, an archaism, used for the sake of the metre, for heri.
The most ancient Latin form of the word was hesi (seen in hesternus),
which is from χθὲς, originally χίς. The Latins always substitute the
soster form of the aspirate for the rough ,¹5,—Atque eadem cras deteret
exiquis aliquid. “ And this same [scil. res] will experience to-morrow
some diminution of its bulk, small as it is already.”—Detcro is prop.
“to file down.” The present phrase is unusual, res deteritur being
more correct.

25. F atiyatus is said of the mind, fessus of the body-ubi, scil.
Cumae, whither Daedalus fied from Crete—Daedalus, of this great
artist nothing is known with certainty; it is even asserted by many
that he had no actual existence, but that a mere mythic personage is
meant, and the name is intended to apply to any ingenious artificer. It
is certain that the common account is erroneous which states that he
had attained eminence in Athens previously to his residence in Crete.
For owing to its uninterrupted intercourse with Egypt, Crete was sar
in advance of the mother country Greece [Crete was a. Doric colonyj,
in wealth and in intelligence, in its laws and arts. Theseus, the
Athenian hero, wished to transplant to Attica the arts as well as the
laws, and while he gave to his countrymen a similar system of policy,
he did not fail to secure the co-operation of one whose knowledge might
yield powerful aid in humanizing a rude people, by adding new dignity
to the objects of national veneration. Accordingly, Daedalus, it is pro-
bable, accompanying the conqueror of the Minotaur to Athens, fixed
there the commencement osan improved style, 1234 nc. Some of his
works are described as existing in the 2d century—We are not to un-
derstand with some that he introduced sculpture into Greece, or even
into Attica ; but simply that he was the first to form something like a
school of art there.

26. Dum πουα, 610. “ While hoary hairs are yet new to me, and
while old age is incipient and upright.”——Rect‹z senectus, is said of one
who though advanced in γεω-5, can walk straight and upright.--S enectus.
Age (ἡλίκα) was divided into pueritia (παιδία) which was within 15,

Ι Adolescentza, (ἔφηβῖα nia-213 )within 30, juventus within 45, and senectus,
'7353oess which compi-ised the remaining period of life—senectus prima,
or recta, was called’ υμογερουσίιι. The form of expression is derived from
the Latin proverb. Clotho Jirtfnsum, Lachesis rotat, Atropos occat.

27. Dum, ἀφ’ ‘While something remains for Lachesis to spin,''

Lachesis is from λαγχάνειν sortior. The Fates, called by the Greeks
Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos, were by the Latins termed Nona.
Decima, and Morta. —torqueat, this word, as well as vers are, is used
for nere “to spinss 'from the notion of turniny the spindle or thread.
It 15 derived from egerim “to turnss’ metathes. τοριτίω, AEol. τιμίω.
“’ 29. Cedamusst ‘let us depart! ’—Artorius and Catulus were mean
individuals, who, by bad practices had attained to wealth.—By his saying
“let Artorius and Catulus live there, &c.,” he means that Rome was
now only fit for such abandoned characters.

30? Maneant, dxc. “let such persons remain as turn black into white,
as find it easy to contract for the building of a temple, the clearing out
of rivers, and harbonrs, the cleansing of the public sewers, the carrying
forth of a corpse to the tomb, and to expose a head for sale beneath
the imperial-spent? i. e. “to seu a slave by public auction.”-—-30
