huge crack‚ he bids us sleep without fear, whilst our domicile is threat-
ening to fall about our ears,'’ lit. “ whilst a crashing fall is impending

satirically called Villicus in Sat. 4. 77. and perhaps under the Emperors

Rome, and reads multa incendia, multi Nocte metus, for this reason,
that in both the preceding and subsequent lines the city is referred to ;

dvc„ as though the conflagration were before his eyeS.

198. Jam poscit aquam, scil. to quench the flames—F rivola, “his
lumber.’' The etymology which some assign to frivolus, namely sere
