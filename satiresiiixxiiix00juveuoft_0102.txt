56 NOTES ΟΝ JUVENAL.

care. Enim, “ forsooth.”—Et tamen, dvc. “ And yet, poor luckless fel-
low, he lost his all, trifiing as it was.”-Perdo from «iesu.

209. Ultimus aerumnae cumulus, “ the finishing stroke of his calamity
was, that‚’' ἀει, or “the final aggravation of his missortunes.”—We
’ have no good authority for stating that (erumna (from αἰρομένη) origin-
ally meant “ a stick on which travellers carried their burdens,’' and that
hence it received the more general meaning of “ toi1‚” “ hardship.” It
is with greater probability deduced from the word afgopn‘m in the sense
of “ raised‚'’ “ suspended,’' and thus it is easily transferred to the mind.
from the notion of suspense and anxiety.--Cumulus. This is a meta—
phor from the measuring of dry substances ; the cumulus was that por·
tion which was piled on when a measure was already filled to the brim.
—Frusta‚ thc scholiast reads frustra, which would violate the metrez'
and the force of which is already included in nemo juvat.

211. Hospitio tectoque, “with hospitality and shelter‚’' i. e. “with
hospitable shelter.”

212. Si magma, seqq. When a poor man suffers the loss of his effects ·

by fire, there is no one to assist him ; but when a rich man has met with
a similar calamity‚ all are ready to extend to him sympathy and aid.—'
Asturii, a feigned name, put sor any wealthy individual.-Horrida
mater, “ every matron is in weeds [forthwith], the nobles are in black,
the Praetor adjourns his courts.''-Horrida‚ lit. “ unadorned,’' as being
in the vestments of mourning. It was customary, in a public mourning sor
any great calamity‚ for the ladies to divest their persons of ornament, for
the senators and Equites to put on toyae of a dark colour, and for a justi-
tium, or cessation os judieial procedings, to be proclaimed. Pullus de-
noted a colour between purple and black.— Vadimonium (see note on
298.)—Proceres. This word is derived, according to some respectable
Etymologists, from προέχω “ to project‚’' as it primarily signified “the
heads or ends of the bcams of a house, which projeci out of the walls.''

214. Tunc yemimus, dxc. ‘¹ Thcn we lament it (scil. the destruction
of the rich man's house) as a national calamity; then we hold all fire in
abhorrence.'’ It was customary with mourners to extinguish their fires,
wherefore Grangaeus correctly understood iynem not as referring to tho
conflagratIOn, but to fire in any direction. Some old editions have

emznus.
9 215. Ardet adlata—The poet now gives a brief but striking picture
of the zeal which the friends of the rich man exhibited in rendering him
assistance—Ardet, ‘⁴ [The house] is still on fire,'' or perhaps Asturius
is understood to ardet, Comp. Ain. 2. 310.—0ccurrit‚ “comes up at
once,’' so καταντᾷ, and ἀπαντᾷ, ‹m' οι· εἷς, iar), A'c. denotes to approach
suddenly and unexpcctedly. The copyists frequently confounded this
verb with accurrit, though the meanings are different. Jam, i. e. ⁰⁴ in·
stantly.'’

house which was destroyed.--Nuda‚ i. c. represented without clothing.
—Candida‚ “os white marble.''
