LUCILIUS, HORACE, PERSIUS, ΛΝΒ JUVENAL. XXXV

liis course to the goal, if he has any, by a long and circuitous route ; so
that his satires may be compared to a walk in which the scenes, which
are remote from the road, are hastily viewed en passam, and all the
path itself is straight* Persius and Juvenal sometimes imitate Horace
in this a1s0; but yenerally, after the manner of the philosophers and
rhetoricians, they take up one position only, and go on with it, hardly
ever digressing; for that carelessness and coolness which are so pleasing
in Horace, are not at all fit for their graver and lostier language. Per-
sius' satires are treatises on some philosophical proposition; J uvenal’s
are rhetorical themes, learned indeed and sometimes ingenious ; but re-
commending themselves rather by the skill with which individual sub—
jects are handled, than by wide poetic genius and invention, in which
those satires are entirely deficient, which review the various vices of one
class of persons only; as for instance, of women, in Juvenal, Sat. 6.

In the connexion of his thoughts, and in the order and collocation of
his subjects, Horace manifests not only that pleasing carelessness and
looseness, which has been spoken of before, but also consummate art,
which, however, he industriously tries to conceal. For, so closely linked
are the subjects 3 so great is the mutual dependence of one on the other;
with such ease does the language flow on ; so congruous is the conclu-
sion with the commencement and the parts with the whole, that one
could scarcely transpose or omit anything without disordering the entire
poem; and a doubt arises as to whether each subject were presented
spontaneously and without effort, or were the result of profound study
and design on the part of the poet. Persius' style, on the other hand,
offends by its abruptness, its bold transitions, harsh transpositions‚ and
frequent introduction of irrelevant matter. Juvenal has rather united
all the parts of his Satire in the style and arrangement of declamation.
than by a complicated and elaborate connexion ; yet he has delineated
and adorned them with masterly skill.

Horace' descriptions‚ similes, and illustrationS‚ point chiefly to the
main features of his subject, and are most happily employed. Not only do
they set forth ideas of a common and easy nature; but those also osa deeply
philosophical description, in the clearest and most convincing light.
Persius either carefully attends to the minutiae, or mixes up foreign
matter, and takes more pains in ornamenting and amplifying the parts,
than in clearly setting forth the whole. Juvenal displays to us images
of vices and errors, in glowing and rich colours, and that too with
skill and dig-nity. In his descriptions he evinces a remarkable know-
ledge of things, and varied and keen powers of mind. In his choice of
illustrations he shows profound judgment, and in their abundance, ex—
tensive learning ; but in the dressing up of his figures he sometimes be—
trays too great labour, and examines too closely things that are of a
very unseemly and indelicate character, passing over nothing which he
considered as calculated to excite a lively feeling of disgust or scorn.

The language which Horace employs is of a common and humble strain
(“ Musa pedestris,’' and “ sermones per humum repentes,'’ Sat. 2. 6,
17, and Epist. 2. l, 250) ; but neat, natural, choice, and pure, exactly
adapted to matters relating to the customs of common life, evenly flow-
ing, displaying a felicitous ease, and distinguished by a certain unac-
countable charm, grace and simplicity. That of Persius is losty, crowded

ι “Omnis cia recta est.'' This expression of Ruperti's which may at first sight
oonvey a contradiction ω his preceding remarks, is to be understood as ap lymg
to the real intentimt of Horace* sam-es, which is ‘oo reprove and correct w t is
wrong.
