ΟΝ ROMAN SATIRE.

[SUGHTLY ALTERED FROM RUPERU]

'rma custom of indulging in ridicule and invective is universal among
mankind, as we are urged to it by the natural bent of our disposition
and an innate feeling of gaiety. Hence also it prevailed in those as-
semblies of rustics, which were held principally in honour of Ceres and
Bacchus, at periods very remote, and which somewhat resembled our
harvest-home. In these assemblies the rural youth, exempt from mental
solicitude, were wont to return prayers of thanksgiving, and present an
oblation of first-fruits to the deity; they sung besides an unpolished
song which they accompanied with certain gesticulations. This song
at first had forits subject, themes commendator-y of gods and demigods;
but afterwards, both between and after their banquets, it degenerated
to sarcastic bon mots, uttered in alternate verses, extemporaneous,*
and consequently uncouth in style, in which the rustics heaped copious
abuse on those who might chance to pass, and on each other ; the re-
laxation of the mind, so natural to the season and their deep potationS,
affording a plea for the undue extent to which they carried their jesting
and derision. By degrees they began to employ some art in these effu-
sions ; they learned to sing, and to adapt their saltatory movements to
regular numbers or meas-ures (ῥυέμος, ,uia—ga καὶ ἁρμονίαι). The Chorus,
which was originally, for the most part, composed of Satyrs, and the
dramatic art (θεατρικὴ μουσικὴ) itself derived their origin hence. These
two methods of representing the song [scil. by singing and by gesticula-
tion] gradually produced the development of the scenio and dramatic
art of the Greeks ; the one produced Tragedy, thc other Comedy. More·
over, from these choruses of Satyrs, represented by rustics, in very
primitive times, thus giving vent to drunken merrimcnt, and striving to
excite mirth by every species of witty and wauton language, the satyrio
fables of the Greeks arose, a species of composition closely allied to
Tragedy in its plot, but, to Comedy in the composition ; but which tem—
pered the sadness of the former with the airiness and lightness of the
latter ; a proof of which is, that not very long after Thespis [the inventor
of tragedy] flourished, the satiric fable formed a portion of the tetralogy
in the contests of the tragic poets. It was always acted aster the three
tragedies of each poetical aspirant to the prizc of the Dionysia, in order
to dispel whatever of gloom the poi fei-mance of the tragedies may have
induced. In addition to these tragico-satyrio fables (only one of which,

ἓ “ Extemporaneous,” such verses-were called by the Greeks αὐτοσχεδιάσμσιτα.
(almezio, ᾅσματα, or ςσίπματα.
