time, among each other, ludicrous expressions in coarse verses, and with
gestures adapted to the words: this kind of performance then being
received with approbation, in the course of frequent practice gained
much improvement. The native performers were called Histriones,
from the Tuscan word Hister, signifying ‘ a player ;’ and they did not,
a's formerly, pronounce alternately, without regard to order, verses like
the Fescennine, artless and unpolished, but represented eomic medleys,
(saturas), composed in regular metre, with the several parts of the per-
sormance properly adjusted to the music; the delivery of the words and
the gesticulation being performed in concert with the music. Several
years after this, Livius, who was the first that ventured to lay aside
medleys (he produced the first regular drama at Rome A. u. c. 514.) and
to digest a story into a regular plot, being also, as all were at that time,
the actor of his own pieees; and having broken his voice by being
obliged to repeat them too often, after requesting the indulgence of the
public, placed a boy before the musician to chaat, while he himself
performed the gesticulations. (It was customary, at the end of every
act, to ebant a set of verseS, accompanied by the music, and with cor-

respondent gesticulations). And this he executed with much freer -

action, because disengaged from attention to the management of his
voice. Hence originated the practice of the chanting being performed,
by another, to the gesticulation of the actors whose voices were eased
of all but the dialogue. When, by this regulation the scenic business
was directed to other objects than laugbter and intemperate mirth, and
the amusement was, by degreeS, converted into an art, the younger
citizens, leaving to professed actors the exhibition of plays began, ’
according to the ancient practice, to throw out alternately ludici-eus
jests, comprised in verse, which thence got the name of exodia, or in·
tex-ludes, and were collected principally out of the Atellane sarces. This
kind of entertainment, thus borrowed from Oscia, these younger citizens
kept in their own hands, not suffering it to be debased by professed players.
For this reason the rule was established, which is stili observ-ed, that
the actors of these Atellano sarcos are not dcgraded from their tribe, and
are capable of serving in the army. as if no way concerned in the busi-
ness of the stage. Among the trifling beginnings of other matters, 1
thought it not amiss to give a view of the origin of theatrical exhibitione
also, in order to show from a moderate setting out, to what an intolera-
ble extravagance they have proceeded; such extravagancc, indeed, as
scarcely to be supported by opulent kingdoms.''‘

In thesables alluded to above. which derived their name from Atella
a town of the Osci in Campania (whence also the actors spokc in the
Oscan dialect), the language was rude and unpolished, but rather re·
pletc with humorous banter, than with indelicacy or lewdness : the plot
was ehaste, and the train of sentiment pure and creditable; hence Valer-
ius Maximus says, ⁴⁴ this species of amusement was blended with, and
regulated by. that austerity of tone which characterized the ltaliam, and
therefore it did not come under censure.'' 2. 24.
