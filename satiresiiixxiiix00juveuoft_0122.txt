project of Sejanus. One MS. has Turba Remus, of which Heinsius
approves, who states it as his opinion that the Romans were called Re-
menses stom Remus, as Ramnenses from Romulus, and Titienses from
Titus Tatius. As the Emperor was often designated Quirinus er Ro-
mulus, so Sejanus the second in command, may be hinted at by the
name Remus—his fate too was similar.

73. Sequitur Fortunam, dte. i. e. as long as good fortune attends a
man, he enjoys the favour of the rabble ; but when the former deserts
him, the latter quits him also. Comp. Hor. Od. 1. 35. 25. At vulqus
infidum,—cedit.

74. Nursia. A goddess of the Etrurians, and Volsinians. The same
as Fortuna.— Tusco, Sejanus.

75. Si oppressa soret, 1118. “ If the unapprehensive old Emperor had
been crushed, that same hour (scil. of Tiberius’ death) would hail
Sejanus Emperor.’'—Opprimere expresses the idea of being seized
unawares.— Secura ; this word is subjective and relative, i. e. it refers
to the thoughts of the person spoken of ; tutus is objective and absolute,
i. e. it means really safe, whether the person thinks so or not.—Au9us- Α
tum, Greek Σιβαστὸν.

77. 78. Jam pridem, dxc. The Roman populace being now long ac-
customed to inactivity, and 10 the yoke of the Caesars, had forgotten
their ancient freedom, and would not, had the opportunity of Tiberius'
death been presented, have made an effort to regain it.—chm pridem,
1118. “ Long ago, in fact, ever since we made sale of our votes to no
candidate, have the people dismissed all concern (for the administration
of public affairs.)'' Julius Caesar partially deprived the people of the
jus sztffrayii by nominating the Consuls himself, and recommending
one half of the inferior magistrates to be elected. Augustus restored
most of the power of which they had been deprived, and enacted severe
penalties against bribery. Tiberius, however, transferred the comitia
entirely from the Campus Martius to the Senate-house, thus totally
depriving the people of their old privilege. The clause, 111811, cx quo
suffrayia nulli vendimus is equivalent to, “from the time that our
right of election was taken from us.’'—Effudit conveys strong sarcasm:
as though from their love of indolence they spontaneously pai-ted with
their privileges at the beck of their despots. Some Edd. exhibit the
lection effuyit.

78. Nam qui, scil. (populus).

79. Imperium (cummiani—Fasces. scil. the dictatorship, consulship,
and praetorship. F acces and lessiones are in apposition with imperium.

satire was written in the time of the latter Emperor. But panis may well
