“ a jewel-box.” Quinctilian produces this term as an example of cate-
chresis, because it properly denoted that which was made of box (πύξος),
but was applied to things of similar form and use made of any other
μ material. In fact, the caskets in which the ladies of ancient times kept
their jewels and other ornaments, were made of gold, silver, ivory,
mother-of-pearl, tortoise-shell, dxc. They were also much enriched
with chasing. The same term is applied to boxes used to contain
drugs or poison (as in the present passage); and to metallic rings em-
ployed in machinery. The box in this place is put for the poison, by
the figure, metonymy

even worse than the times of iron, for the criminality of which nature

The amount of annotation upon this sentence from numerous commen-
tators is perfectly bewildering. We shall endeavour to give some of
their opinions in as simple a form as possible. (l) Ruperti remarks,
that the ancient poets, in order to exhibit the gradual decay of good
principles in mankind, until the whole racc became a mass of moral
corruption, marked out the time that had elapsed since the creatiou
