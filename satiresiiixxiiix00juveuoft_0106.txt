his hobnails are driven into my toe.’' The soldier’s caliqa was wont to
be stuck full of clavi, or large nails with the points projecting out-
wards, in order to render their footing more firm, whence the latter
were called caliyares.

249. The poet now gives a description of another kind of crowd that
incommodes the poor in the streets.—“ Quanto celebretur sportula fu-
moT’ “ with how great smoke the sportula is attended‚” i. e. how many
persons are zealously soliciting the sportula, as you may see by the
smoke. The Roman nobles anciently were wont to invite their re-
tainers to supper, who usually attended them from the forum. Under the
emperors this custom was abolished‚ and a little basket of meat was given
to each to carry home. Nero ordered a small sum of money to be dis-
tributed instead of meat, and Domitian brought back the former prac-
tice. Perhaps it was subsequently left optional; for we find elsewhere
in Juvenal that money was again distributed, The sum was 100 quad-
rantes; that is about 20d. In the present passage, not the money, but
the supper is meant. The word is derived from σπυςὶς, “ a little bas-
ket,’' or from spartum, “ Spanish broom,’' of which, according to some, .
the basket was composed. It is equivalent here to the Greek δεῖπνον i,
erm) ι’δι.

2ἷῑο. Culina. F acciolati says this word here means “his dinne'r,” but
there is no necessity for taking it in a different sense from its usual one.
namely “ kitchen.” It was a larger kind of chafing·dish‚ divided into
two cells, in the uppermost of which they put the meat, and in the lower,
fire, to keep it warm. Perhaps it is derived from κόλον ·‘food,” qu.
colina, or from coquo, qu. amulium—The centum convivoe mentioned
in this line are the rich clients who are returning to their homes after
having received the sportula; and by saying that each has his own
kitchen following him, the poet means that his slave is behind him
carrying it upon his head.

251. Corbulo, i. e. one so strong as Corbulo. Some say that the
allusion is to an athlete os that age; others to Domitius Corbulo, a
valiant and powerfully-made general under Claudius and Nero.

252. Recto vertice, “ with head ercet and steady,'’ scil. lest the gravy
should be spilt. Probably quot for quas should be adopted from re-
spectable editions of our author published in the fiftccnth and sixtceuth
century. We must render quas here, ⁴· as,” or, “as those which.’'

263. Et cursu ventilat iynem, “and fans the fire by his rapid mo-
tion.’' i. e. the fire which was in the lower division of the culina.

254. Tunicae sartoe, namely the coats os the poor pedestrians “are
torn in the press of the crowd.'' We are now told of another peril
which the poor man, in his progress through the streets‚ has to encoun-
ter. Such was the danger resulting to passcngcrs from the long beams
which were conveyed through the city on wnggons, that a law had been
passed to the effect that waggons thus loaded (unless for the construction
of sacred buildings, (ke.) should not pass through the streets after sun·
rise. or before the tenth honr (4 r. M.) when the Romans would be at ·
«liniter. Mettarius was the first who discovered a fragment of this old
law, in the year 1738. It is evident from Umbricius< complaints that
this ennctnnent was forgottcn in Jnvonnl's time, or perhaps this whole
passage is an indirect satire against the Emperor-’s mania sor buildfflg:
in that case it is probablc that the Emperor's wnggons were excluded
from the restriction iinposed by the law.-Coruscat, ‘¹ vibrates,'' ‘¹ sways
to and fro.”
