36 noras on JUVENAL. ’

Niyrum in candida vertunt, i. e. who can make falsehood have the
semblance of truth, and vice the appearance of virtue.

31. Facile, i. e. on account of their wealth, bribery, and ser-¹
vility.-Conducere oedem, scil. extruendam, vel reficiendam. Gesner,
Bentley, and the majority of the eminent critics maintain that cedes
in the singular can only signify “ a sacred edifice‚’' ‘¹ a temple,” whilst
in the plural it means ‘⁴ a house.'’ Both Jahn and Mitscherlich‚ how-
ever, contend that this distinction was not attended to, even by the
writers of the Augustan age, and accordingly they would translate
oedem here “ an edifice,’' whether public or private. Heinsius tells us
that the original signification of the word was “an apartment,” and so
was peculiarly applied to a temple which at first had only one apart-
ment ; then as a house has many apartments, the plural easily came to
have that meaning.—Conducere here is the same as redimere, the
opposite to which is locare. The building and repairing of public edi-
fices were contracted for generally by persons of equestri-‘in rank ; the
Censors and AEdiles had the power of assigning whom they pleased as
contractor. Private buildings were also contracted for at Rome by
private persons, and hence some read oedes here for oedem.-Some
understand by flumina “the fisheries,'' and by portus, “the harbour-
dues,’' i. c. the tax which was levied from the ports of Italy and the
provinces for the importation and exportation of commodities (pro
invehendis et evehendis mercibus) which was properly called VECTIGAL.
Others take portus to refer to the “ construction and reparation of
harbours.”—32. Those who contracted for funerals were called desig)-
mztores, and libitinarii.-—Bustmn, from buro same as mo (not from
bene), is properly “the place where a corpse has been burnt and
buried.’' The b in bustum supplies the place of a lost digamma.—
Cadaver is not from caro data vermibus, but from cado, as κίνημα and
πει-ὦμοι from πίπτω, and our “carcass,” from caro and cass, “flesh-
ntus-‚⁹¹—3a On this line Ruperti has the following remarks :——Many
refer this verse to the individnal slaves which Artorius and Catulus
exposed sor sale; which method of traffic was exceedingly lucrative;
but since the poet now talks os those wealthier persons who farmed tho
revenueS, I am inclined to think that not the manybncs or slave-dealers
are mentioned in the text, but tho farmers of the tax οη salcable com-
modities‚ which was levied on those things that were sold only in the
forum, or under the spem· which was set up publicly ; to this class the
nzanoipia, or slaves chiefly belonged, who were peculiarly termed vena·
les or venalilii, and were purchased up by the slave-dealers to be sold
again. When Augustus was in want os money to carry on his wnrs
and to maintain his night-watenes, ho appointed a tax of the both
part of tho value of slaves that were sold [i. c. 2 ἷῑξ cent.], according
to Dio Cassius. Tacitus tells us that afterwards, probably under
Caligula. this tax was raised to tho 25th part [4 ἢ) comt—domimi!
hasti. The sprar, which was sot up as a sign of a public nuntiem}
was called domina, as iinplying the ‹limaim’on over the person and lise Ι
of the slave, which was then and thoro vested in the purchaser. Per· ἶ
haps tho custom of crccting tho. spcar arose from selling spoils ⁰s war
originally. Domina is here used as an adjective: comp. AEn. 1. 16.
Hinc populum laec regycm, i. e. regnantem. Caput, is either used in its
proper signification. or figuratis-ely, as frequently to denote the life.
