soretuned the dying notes of Rome, Till I thy consul sole consoled thy-
doom.'' Gifford, ‘¹ How fortunate a natal day was thine‚ In that proud
consulate, Ο Rome, of mine.’' Others translate, ‘¹ Ο Rome fortunate
renate under my consulate ;'' or, ⁸¹ Ο Roman state, born great, under
my consulate.” Cicero in this line alludes to his having frustrated
Cataline’s treasonable pians.

scil. as his poetry. The meaning is that Antony never would have
deemed Cicero worthy of his fatal notice had his oratory been as con-
temptible as his poetry.

124. Ridenda, dvc. “ Ι would rather have been the author of [scripsisse]
poems fit only to be laughed at, than of thee, Ο noble Philippic, of dis-
tinguished fame, which art read next in order after the first.” i. e. the
second. Cicero called his 14 orations against Antony “ Philippiee‚’' in
imitation of those delivered by Demosthenes against Philip.

126. Volverer, literally, ‘⁴ art unrolled,'' alluding to the ancient
volumes which were wound round a roller.-—Et illum, ‘⁸ the former also,”
Demosthenes‚—see note on 114.-A primti proxima, “the second.’'

127. Mirabantur, ἱθαιόμαζαν.

128. Torrentem, ὼε. “ impetuously eloquent, and swaying the passione
of the crowded popular assembly,'' literally ‘¹ managing the reins ;'' a
metaphor from horsemanship. Some of the old commentators ridicu-
]ously refer this to the fact of Demosthenes having appropriated the
theatrical fund for state purposes of weightier importance, and having
thereby diminished the member of spectators. According to this the
words would be rendered ‘⁶ curbiny the reins of the crowded theatre.'¹
But this could not be the meaning; sor moderari applied to a box-seman,
is simply ¹¹ to manage,'' “ direct ;'’ and the reference of the whole pas-
sage is confined altogether to Demosthenes’ powers of oratory.—F renum
is qu. srendinum, from frendo “to champ.¹’— Torrentem, Compare
πολύς ῥιᾶἱν, and, multo salsoque ruenti, Hor. Sat. 7. 23.

129. Fato—sinistro. It was adverse fortune which made Demos-
thenes an orator: he would have been much happier had he been a
word-cutim, μαχαιροποῖσς, like his father.

130. Quem, dvc. ‘⁴ Whom his father, blear—eyed from the reek of the
red—hot. mass of iron, sent away from ceals and pincers, aud from the
anvil that sorged sword-blades. and from sooty Vulcan to a rhetorician,”
to learn oratory. His father was a sword-cutler in large business, and
kept twenty-two men constantly employed, in addition to a considerable
number of conch-makers.—Massa, Greek padsseos.—Forceps is qu. ferri-

Ιησᾶεὶε, Eamne—Latous is ⁴‘ dirty.'' ⁸⁴ sooty,‘' luteus is of the colour of
the herb Istrum. Vulcan was the god os firc and sorges, and the epitliet
lutcus is given him here in allusion to the sullied faces os smiths, who
were his descendants as it were. Jacobs has conjectured the lection

proved destructive to the aspirants. 133. Truncis affixa trophoet's,
