vi BRIEF CHRONOLOGY.

Α· U· C ΑΕ ⁰¹²· AE‘· ¹²¹· Aquilinus ; Prudentius, Amoenus, dxc.) His na·
tive place was Aquinum, a town of the Volsci,

Aquino.

801 48 7 Messalina the abandoned wife of the emperor Clau-

802 49 8 We have nothing certain transmitted to us respect-
ing J uvenal’s instructors. Henninius, relying on
the authority of Crinitus, and others, maintains
that he was most carefully brought up by' Fronto
the grammarian, who, according to Gellius was
famed at Rome as a teacher in those years, and
on account of his fame got the education of J uve-
nal intrusted to him ; others, sor the same reason,
say Quintilian. But any one will see that the
argument on which these assertions rest is per-
fectly weak and inconclusive; for were there not
then many grammarians and rhetorieians, equally
famous with Fronto and Quintilian, and whose
schools were equally accessible to Juvenal? In·
deed Juvenal could not have been at their schools
at all, inasmuch as Quintilian was born about the
same year as our author, and Fronto many years
later. Undoubtedly the Marcus Cornelius Fronto
the famous rhetorician, of whom Gellius speaks.
was the preceptor of M. Antoninus the philosopher
and his brother Verus, the former of whom was
born. A.u.c. 874. An. Ch. 121.
