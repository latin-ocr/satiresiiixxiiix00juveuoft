SATIRE 111. 55

know whether the Codrus, here mentioned as being in straitened cir-
cumstances, be the poet spoken of in Sat. l. 2. Grangaeus thinks that
this mention of Codrus’ bed has reference to the Greek proverb Κλεο-
μένης τῆς κωίτπς ὑπερέχει, i. e. Cleomenes was so poor, as to be unable to
procure a bed large enough for himself.

204. Abaci, “ of his marble side-table‚'’ or “slab,'’ ἅβακος. The
abacus was a table of marble, (called also m 'nister-ium and repositorium)
on which gold and silver drinking-vessels particularly (here the urceoli)
were set out, both for use and display. Abacus, (ἅβαξ) denoted gener·⁵
ally and primarily, any flat surface; thence it is applied to the flat square
stone above the capital of a pillar ; to the square panels in ceilings ; a
tray with a· raised border, containing sand, used chiefly by mathemati-
cians, or in arithmetic; a sideboard, or cabinet, having partitions for
holding cups, dre. We are informed that articles of this last descrip-
tion were introduced at Rome from Asia Minor, after the victories of
C. Manlius Vulso,—A.U.c. 567.

205. Cantharzcs, “ a can, from which they poured the wine into the
urceoli‚” Κάνθαρος. This word received its name from Cantharus‚ an
artisan of Sicyon, the inventor. It was always used as a drinking-cup,
was furnished with two handles, and was sacred to Bacchus, as the
scyphus was to Hercules—Et recubans sub eodem marmore Chiron,
“and a recumbent Chiron (i. e. a statue or pillar representing the
figure of Chiron the centaur) supporting (sub) the marble slab of the
same material [as itselfJ,'' eodem. Valesius would read ec recubans
sub eo de ‘marmore Chiron, whereby sub eo, scil. Cavztharo would be
used for in eo, or in pede ejus marmoreo, where Chiron is supposed to
be lying in a drunken sleep. Manso purposes to read Echinus for
Chiron, comparing Hor. Sat. 1, 6, 116; but the expression recubare
could not be applied to this—Marmore is generally thought to be here
used ironically, as, on account of Codrus’ extreme poverty, it may seem
strange that the abacus would be of marble ε but we learn from many
sources that marble shelves or tables were common amid the poorer
classes at Rome, while the rich used more costly materiam, such as
citron-wood or ivory.

207. Et divina, &c.—“ And Vandal, Gothic,’' (i. e. “soulless,” “ sa-
vage‚'') mice gnawed away at those verses of celestial inspiration.'’ Poor
Codrus had his few books stowed in an old chest into which, from its rot-
tenness, the mice had an easy method of ingress. Carmina divina,
however may be an ironical allusion to “the leeseid‚’' if this be the
Codrus spoken of in l, 2 ; but it is better explained as referring to the
lofty productions of the Greek pocts, Comp. Dia poemata, Pers. 1. 31.
-Opici. The Opici (same as the Osci, according to Festus) were an
Ausonian tribe on the banks of the Liris in Latium and Campania. On
their admission among the Romans they introduced many barbarous in-
novations into the language and manners of that people. It is said by
some that from the indecent tendency of the Oscan plays and Iudicrous
exhibitions, the word obscenus is derived, quasi Oscenus. The poet here
humorously terms thc mice Opici, since they had no respect for the
divina Carmina.

208. Nil, “ comparatively nothing‚” ‘¹ next to nothing.’' The Greek
phrase was ἔχειν οὐδέν, οὔκ ἔχειν, scil. xgn'paoeaem—Neyat. This word is from
ne and aio ‘¹ to say‚” properly therefore it means “ to say ⁷w‚'’ and is
thus precisely equivalent to the Greek ἀναίνομαι, which is from ἄν·-
“ no.'' Neqare, which is of the first conjugation‚ is thus formed from
a verb of the third, just as from dicere comes not judicere but judi-
