SATIRE ΧΠ. 147

295. AEstivitm tonat. “ It is but a summer thunder-shower.”——In-
selice, ὢο. “ Perhaps this very night, the vessel's timbers being shivered,
that wretch will be undone, and be overwhelmed and engulphed in the
billowy main, while firmly he will hold his girdle by his left hand and
by his teeth.'' The ancients carried their money in their girdles.

297. Et zonam. His avarice will increase his danger3 for by holding
the purse in his hand and teeth he incapacitates himself in a great
measure from swimming.

298. Sed cujus votis, dcc. “ And so, that man for whose aspirations
all the gold which the Tagus and the Pactolus roll in their glittering
sands had not seemed enough a while ago, rags that but cover his
chilled loins, and a scanty quantity of food will now suffice, whilst, as
being a shipwrecked wretch whose vessel has foundered, he suppliantly
solicits the smallest coin, and supports himself by the representation of
a tempest.” It is doubtful whether Ruperti makes these lines refer to
the same person whose fate is spoken of in 295—297. He explains
cadet by peribit, but this is an ambiguous word, as it may be rendered
⁴⁴ will perish‚’' οι· “will be 1·uined‚” scil. in his circumstances. In his
note on 297 he tells us that the miser prefers to be drowned, rather
than lighten himself in the water by throwing away his money. It is
probable, therefore, that he imagines the dominus drowned, in which
case he must have thought that the words sed votis, ὣς. introduce an-
other avarus mercator, who has escaped to shore with the loss of his
vessel and property. Indeed the three words cadet premetur obrutas
seem too strong to signify merely that the miser got a ducking; more-
over if he retained his money (tenebit) how should we account for his
begging his bread immediately after his preservation? (unless tenebit
will be taken to mean ‘’will strive to retain.'’) It is strange that
Ruperti should not have been more explicit, particularly when he must
have seen that the other commentators make the whole passage from
295 to 302 refer to one and the same individual‚ and consequently that

rising in mount Tmolus. In it Midas washed himself, when he turned
into gold whatever he touched; it henceforward rolled golden sand, and
received the name of Chrysorrhoas. Strabo observes th-at it had no
golden sands in his age. The gold which was found amid its sands was
derived from the mines of mount Tmolus, and when these were ex-
hausted‚ the supply of the river ceased. According to Varro and Chry-
sostom this stream was the chief source of the wealth of Croesus. It is
now called “ the Sarabat.”—-302. Pict tempestate. Those who escaped
from shipwreck or any other imminent calamity, used to carry about a.
painting of the occurrence, to excite compassion and obtain alms from
the charitable. This picture, when it had served its purpose, was de—
dicated to some patron god, (Σωτῆρ, scil. Neptune, Isis, or AEsculapius,)
along with the clothes in which the person had escaped, if any; but in
case of shipwreck, persons disencumber themselves as much as possible
of raiment.

303. Tantis, ὥσ. Even supposing that a man should perform his
voyage successfully‚ and escape the dangers of shipwreck, to which all
who go on sea are exposed; yet the wealth which he has acquired with
such peril to himself will be ever a source of uneasiness and disquietude.

304. diesem, ‘¹ care-fraught,” “ productive of solicitude.''

word ἅμη in Greek signified “a spade,'' “a shovel.’' Humze in the
