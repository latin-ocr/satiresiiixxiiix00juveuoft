the origin of the Lares. Varro and Macrobius say that they were the
children of Mania. Ovid makes them to have been the offspring of
Mercury and the Naiad Lara, whom Lactantius and Ausonius call
Larunda. Apuleius affirms that they were the posterity of the Le-
mures. Nigridius, according to Arnobius‚ makes them sometimes the
guardians and protectors of houses, and sometimes the same with the
ν Curetes of Samothracia, or Idaei Dactyli. Varro was not more con-
sistent in his opinion of these gods, sometimes making them the same ⁴
as heroes, and sometimes gods of the air. Titus Tatius, king of the
Sabines, was the first who built a temple to the Lares, The word
comes from the Etruscan Lar, “ conductor,'' ‘⁴ leader.'‘

21. Tum felix, dvc. ‘⁸ Who is then in his clement, as often as, after
summoning the executioner, some one of his slaves is branded with a
red-hot iron, for a couple of towels (lost or stolen),”—Duo lintea is put
for anything of trivial rame—Ardenti ferm. Red—hot iron plates ‘were
used in putting slaves to the torture, or for branding with the three
letters F V R.

23. Quid suadet, dic. What advice, says the poet. is a father able to
give his son, if he (the father) delights in the clanking of chains with
which the slaves were loaded iu the prisons?

24. Quem refers to the famen—Mire afficiunt “wondrously denghtff’
—Insm-ipta, ‘⁶ branded,” scil. on the forchead.--——Er9astula. This word
is here taken to signify the “ slaves'’ confined in the erqastulum. The
ergastulum (from ἒςγιὶζεσθιιι “ to work'’) was a private prison attached
to most Roman farms (called in this line carcer rusticus), where the
slaves were made to work in chains. It appears to have been usually
under ground. The slaves confined therein were also employed to
cultivate the fields in chains. 'Slavcs who had displeased their masters
were punished by imprisonment in the eryastulum: and in the same
place all slaves, who could not be depcnded upon, or were barbarous in
their habits, were regularly kept. A trustworthy slave had the care of
the ergastulum, and was therefore called eryastularius. According to
Plutarch, these prisons arose in consequence of the conquest of Italy
by the Romans, and the great number of barbarous slaves who were
employed to cultivate the conquered lands. In the time of Hadrian and
Antoninus, many enactments were made to ameliorate the condition of
slaves; and among other salutary measureS, Hadrian abolished the
eryascula, which must have been liable to great abuse in the hands os
tyrannical masters—Inscripta cryastula, then, means ‘¹ brandcd slaves,''
in the present passage, the abstract being used sor the concrete. Hence
Plautus calls slaves literati, ‘¹ nien of letters‚'' and Cicero calls a man
who was compunctus notis, ¹⁸ stipulatio-‘ff' Lucan in his Cataplus gives
a similar individual the epithcts ot* κατάγμρκ. στιγματίας.

27. Tanto conterere cursu, dc. ¹· String theru together with such
rapidity, that she would not have to take breath thirty times?” So
numerous were Larga's ‘⁴ gallants.'’ that oue could not repeat them
without having to take breath repe:uc‹lly; how then. says J uvenal. can
her daughter be aught but an adulteress herself. from tho influenco of
her mother-'s example?

23. Conscia matri, “ privy to her mothcrs's guilt.''

29. Ceras nunc, «ko. ¹· Now, while her mother dictatos, the daughter
fllls her little tablots, and gives them to tho same internuncios to carry
to her swccthenrts.'' Ceras pusillas may also mean ⁸· little love-letters.’'
‘⁶ petits billcts-doux.” but it is likely that it means that the girl had her
little tablets, as tho young lad his little dice-box (lino 6).—Datserre‚
