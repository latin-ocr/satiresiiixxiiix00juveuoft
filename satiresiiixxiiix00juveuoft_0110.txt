64 sorus on JUVENAL.

and a vagabond Jew. The commentatore are by no means agreed as
to the sense in which Juvenal has used proseucha here. Lubinus and
Prateus think that any place is meant where the mendicants used to
105011, προσευχὸμεηι, asking alms, whether it were a bridge, or tavern,
dcc. Turnebus thinks that beggars, not having a home, used to go to
the proseuchae and lie there. Henninius imagines the sense to be,
⁴‘ Are you one of those vile Jews who, leaving their proseuchae, come
into the city to beg?'’ But Mauso says that verses 13 seqq. and the
Scholiast 00 Sat. 4. 117. at once remove the difficulty ; for from these
we learn that the Jews lived, and had their proseuchae, outside the city,
especially in the vale of Egeria, before the Capene gate, and that they
gave great annoyance by their begging, to passengers both there and
10 1110 Appian road which was near. This latter view appears correct.

297. Si for sive, ‘⁴ whether ;'’ Schrader conjectures seu, but the
emendation is unnecessary.

298. Pariter, “alike,'' 1. 0. whether you answer 01 not, ἱμοίωςμ-
Vadz'mom'a deinde faciunt, “ Then, quite enraged (i. e. as if they were
aggrieved) they institute a prosecution against you ;” lit. “ they cause ”
reeognisances'' to be entered into on your part; i. e. bind you to keep
the peace.’' Vadimonium, (from vas) is properly “a promise to ap-
pear in a court ofjustice, secured by bail.’'

300. Pulsaeus, (110. “ After being soundly beaten he has to beg par·
don (veniam understood), and after being pommelled with the fist, he
has suppliantly to enti-eat that he may be permitted to return from the
place with a few of his teeth left.”-Pulsatffs, assaulted.”

302. Nec tamen, (hc. We are now told of· the pei-ils from robbers.
—Nec metuas, ¹‘ Nor are you to fearf—Qm· spoliet te, ‘¹ to rob you.'’

303. Clausi-5 domibus, &Q “ When the houses have been shut up.
and the shops are done with business for the day, with every shutter
well secured by chains,‘⁷ or more lit. “ when, in all directions, every shut-
ter of the shop secured with chains, being made fast, has become
silent ;” but compayo tabernae is for taberna. Nero, according to Sue-
tonius, was guilty of frequent acts of burglary.

305. Subitus, (110. “ Τ110 active bandit does your business, igyoegiwaj'
or subitus for subito. The meaning of this is. that when the bandini
were dislodged from their retreats in other parts of Italy, they used to
flock to Rome; and it is of the dangers of the city, be it remembered.

307. Pomtinoe paludes, (01· Pontinoe) was a mars-hy tract of country
in the territory of the Volsci, deriving its appellation from the town of
Suessa Pometia (qu. Pometina conti-acted into Pomtina) in whose vici-
nity it was situate. They are now called Paludi Pontiae. These
fens are occasioned by the quantity of water carried into the plain by
numberless streams which spring from the foot of the adjacent mountains,
aud for want of a sufficient declivity. crcep sluggishly over the level
space, and sometimes stagnate in pools, or 1050 themselves in the sands.
'Pwo rivers principally contributed to the formation of these marshes,
the Ufens. (Ufl‘cnte) and the Nymphmus (Ninfo). The flat and swampy
tract spread to the soot 01· 1110 Volscian mountains. and covered an ex-
tent of eight miles in breadth. and thirty in length,with mud and insec—
11005 matter. Appius Claudius. A. υ. 446. when employed in carrying his
celebrated rond through these marshes, made the first attempt to dmin
them. Cornelius Cethegus. in Λ.υ. 500, drained them more completely.
Julius Coesar is said to have intended to divert the course of the Tiber
