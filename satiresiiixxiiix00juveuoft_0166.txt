for?'’ What right have the guilty to expect any favour from Heaven.”

235. Even the most inconsiderable victim‚ a cock, for example, is
“ more deserving of existence than they.”

236—249. Juvenal now proceeds to give the last topic of consolation
to Calvinus :—“ The character of bad men‚” says he, ‘⁴ is generally
- shifting and changeable,’' so that they go on in their career of crime; for
they begin to bethink themselves of their misdeeds after the perpetra-
tion of a crime, but when the opportunity occurs of committing another,
their depraved nature impels them strongly to its commission. From
this the poet infers, that the wicked man never ceases in his evil con-
duct, until he is detected and brought to punishment.

237. Superest constantia, “ they acquire permanent firmness,¹’ liter-
ally “ constancy (scil. in criminal conduct) remains to them ;’' or, “ they
have a superabundant confidence.

239. Tamen, (bc. “ Yet their evil propensity, now fixed and immuta-
ble, flies back to the practices which they had condemned‚’' in their
better moments; or, damnatos may be rendered, ‘⁶ deserving of repro-
bation.'’

of transgression2” ·

242. Ejt’ctum, ἀς. “ The blush of shame which he has once banished
from his brow of &asam—Attrita, properly “ rubbed,’' or “worn away‚”
as marble or metals, where a hard and polishcd surface remains.

244. Dabit, dxc. “ Will get his feet into a snare,” scil. which his
crimes are laying for him. A metaphor from catching birds or beasts
in traps or snares; some take laqueum to mean ‘⁴ bonds,” or “ chains.”

245. Niyri, &c. ‘⁴ He will be brought to feel the staple of a dungeon.¹’
——Uncus seems here to mean the staple to which a prisoner's chains
were fixed. Others think that it means, as 'in Sat. 10. 66. the “ drag‚''
or “hook‚” by which the bodies of malefactor-s were dragged about
the streets after execution.

246. Or, if he should escape the punishment os death, he shall be
be banished to some ¹‘ rocky island in the [Egaean sea; Sat. 10. 170.-
Scopalosque frequentes, «tc. “even those cliffs that are crowded with
distinguished exiles.’' The Emperors used to banish state culpi-its

or a Tiresias‚” i. e. “ blind.'’ For Tiresias was a blind prophet of
'Phebes.—— Surdum, scil. so as not to hear prayers, vows. and perjuries
-“ blind,'' so as not to see the decds of men.
