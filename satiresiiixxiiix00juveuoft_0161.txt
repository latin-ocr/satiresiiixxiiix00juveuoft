entire?'' i. e. to melt down a whole statue of Jupiter.

154. Artifices mercatoremque veneni, “the compounders and the pur-
chaser of poison.” Mercator does not here signify the “vender‚'' but
him who purchases it to poison another. We have the authority of
Cicero sor using the word in this sense.

155. Et deducendum, dvc. “ Compare also the man who ought to be
thrown into the sea. wrapt in an ox-hide,’' he alludes to the parricide :
the first who underwent this punishment was P. Malleolus, convicted of

157. Hoec quota, dte. “ How small a portion is this of the crimes

light sets.” Rutilius Gallicus Valens was prefect of the city, and chief
magistrate of the police, in the reign of Domitiam—Luczfero, Lucifer.
Ἐωσφῦρος, was the morning star. The words of our author do not mean
that Gallicus literally sat in court from the morning till evening ; but
the phrase is used in a. popular sense, namer, that he was concinually
hearing the most atrocious crimes.

164. (ἴων-αἶα, ἀρ. “ Who is amazed at the German's sea-green eyes,'’
dxc. see Hor. Epod. 16. 7.—Flavam, ξανθήν. The Germans and Gauls
had hair rather red than “yellow‚'’ (rufus, πυρρδς, ratherrthan flavus.)
This was partly natural, and partly the effect of art, as they coloured
the hair with a composition like soap, called lye, which they made of
tallow and ashes. The Roman ladies also were very fond of yellow and
reddish hair, and used to colour theirs with ashes and gold dust. In
later times they even purchased the Germans’ hair, and wore it instead
of their own. Procopius calls the Vandals, χρυσοειδεῖς.
