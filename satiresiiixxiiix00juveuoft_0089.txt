SATIRE 111. 43

varies in the MSS. ; cottana, coctana, cotana, cotona, being all found.
Bochart deduces it from the Hebr. -Ι-ςωρ “ parvus.’' Hesychius tells

us that the word signified a small species of fig.

84. Usque adeo, dxc. “ Is it a matter of such utter insignificance that
our infant frames have inhaled,'' ‹itm—the Aventine was one of the seven
hills, now called the Mount of St Sabina.-“ The Sabine berry,'’ is the
olive, which abounded in the Sabine 1ands; itis opposed here to the
Syrian prunes. The meaning of lines 84 and 85 is the following,-—Is
there no advantage in being a Roman ; does our birth not entitle us to
any post of honour?

86. Quid qued, (bc. “ What [are we to say of the fact] that this
people, extraordinary adepts in flattery, extol the words of an illiterate
individual‚” &c.—acl12la⁷⁸·i, perhaps from Soanda—Indoctus, ἀμαθὴς,
ἀπαιδεντος.

88. Lonyum collum, “ the crane-like neck.''—AEquat, ¹⁴ he asserts to
be equal.'’ He compares with.

89. Antoeus was a son of Earth, · in his confiict with Hercules he
received additional strength by falling on his mother’ s bosom; but
Hercules at length held lzim alost and orushed him. The meaning] of
the passage is, that the puny weakling is compared to Hercules when ι
οτένέἱείηρ his most viyorous strenyth.

.Hoec eadem, &c ‘We too may utter like encomiums to these,
*but belief is extended [only] to then1'’ Understand tamum with illis.
—Schrader would read illi for illis, an unnecessary emendation, for
qens (1. 86) is a collectim noun.

93. The connexion is, ‘⁶ [Nor is it any wonder that they are believed,
since they can assume any appearance, and act to the life any part they
please, for] is there a better actor than our Greek when he takes upon
him the part of Thais, or acts a matron or Doric girl covered not even
by the short mantle ; the fact is, a woman all out seems to be speaking,
and not a fictitious character.”— Thais was a common name in comedy
for a courtesan—sustinere, equal to agere-Dorida nullo cul. pall. i. e.
a naked harlot ; not Doris the ocean nymph. The Spartan and Dorio
maids were scantily and thinly clad—the palliolum was a hood, sor
covering the head, usually worn by harlots. The word is a diminutive
from pallium, which is also a diminutive from palla, and this last
according to Hemsterhuis comes from the Greek φᾶρος. The English
‚word ‘¹ cloak'’ though commonly adopted as the translation of this word,
conveys no accurate conception of its form. The article designated
was always a rectanglar piece of eloth, nearly square, and could be
divided into four parts (John xix. 23.)-Persona, πρὸσωπον, properly
“ a mask ;’' here the actor himself.

98. Erit mirabilis illic, “will be considered worthy of admiration in the
art of deception ‚·’' such is Achaintre’s explanation of illio of which Ru-
perti approve33 but the latter conjectures that the correct reading is hinc,
i. e. “ from this attainment of the actors.” The other interpretations of
illic, scil. “in their native Greece,'’ or “at Rome,'’ do not suit. One
copy reads tantum for tamen, and Schrader conjectured the same emen-
dation. Some explain tamen by tandem, [a sense in which it occurs in
Terence, Heauton, 4. 1. 11.]; but there is no occasion to change its
usual signification.—-The persons mentioned in 98, 99, were distinguished
actors of the day—Molli, from personating semales.

100. Comoecla est, “ has a turn for acting,'' “is histrionic by nature.'’
——Meliore cachinno concutitur, “ he is convulsed with a perfect horse-
