been instituted by Servius Tullius. Each of the country tribes was
divided into a certain number of papi: which name was given to the
country adjoining the fortified village, as well as to the village itself.
The Christian writers gave the name of paytini to those persons who
adhered to the old Roman religion, because the latter continued to be
generally believed by the country-people, after Christianity became the
prevailing religion of the inhabitants of the towns—Papus is not froin
πηγὴ “ a fountain,” but from πάγαι, panyo, i. e. jzmqo, as it denotes
a number of houses together.

155. Exiqui, (hc. “ while Ι reap a narrow farin’s most stinted crop.''

156. Scilicet. Here the poet speaks with strong irony. ·‘ Oh, to he
sure, you will be exempt from all the ills that flesh is heir to, in the
same degree as you are free from solicitude respecting the praise and
censure of the world. Riches will certainly effect this sor you.”

157. Effuyz'es, ‘⁴ you will escape.'’—·Et tempora vitm, (bc. “ And
after all this (i. e. in addition to this) a lengthened period of life shall
be given you with sate more prosperous than before.'’

159. Si, (bc. i. e. provided you were so wealthy as to possess all the
land which belonued to the Roman people in the time of Romulus and
Titus Tatius.

161. 1110oe etiam, dic. “ Some time subsequently, even to the vetet-ans
now debilitated by age, and who had borne the brunt of the Punic wars
or formidable Pyrrhus and the swords of Epirus, hardly at length
were two acres each given as a requital for their numerous wounds.''
Ruperti thinks that a line or two may have dropped out of the text
between 160 and 161. The first Punic war began U.C. 489, and lasted
twenty-three years; the second lasted from U. C. 535 till 552. The
third from U.C. 604 till 606, when Carthage was destroyed—Pyrrhum.
This monarch was descended from Achilles by the side of his mother.
and from Hercules by that of his father. He invaded Italy, and was
sor a while successful against the Romans, but at length he received a
severe defeat from Curius, and in consequence was forced to evacuate
the country (B.C. 274). He was killed in Argos by a tile, which an old
woman threw from a house-top.-Illolossi were a people of Epirus, Pyr-
rhus’ kingdom.—163. Those who set out as colonists into a conquer-
ed territory were usually allotted two acres each of the captured land.

164. Merces, dcc. ‘⁴ This compensation for their bloodshed and their
toil was by none ever considered inadequate to their descrts, nor was
the promise of their country, as though ungrateful, considered by any
to be imperfectly fulfilled.”—Curta (visa est) “ seemed to come short
of what it held out.”

166. Salui-abac, “ used to support,” “ maintain.''——Glebula talis
‘¹ such a small pieee of ground,'’ scil. the two acres mentioned above.

167. Patrem, the old soldier who was fractus aetate, &c.— Turbam.
“ the numerous inmates.’'—-Feca ‘⁸ after parturition,’' “in childbed.'’
Ruperti says nothing on this word, and the other commentators erron-
eously render it “ pregnant.’' But the former meaning is much more-
appropriate, compare Liv. 1, 4. F aeta lupa, of the wolf which suckled
Romulus and Remus. It may not be amiss to remark that the word
bears the same signification in Hor. Od. 3, 27, 4 (according to Forbigei·
on Virg. Ecl. l. 50.)
