seats to be furnished with cushions, and it appears that a similar regu-
lation took place afterwards with regard to those of the knights. The
place where the Senators sat was called orchestra ; but in the Greek
theatre the ὀρχήστρα was the lowest part of the building, where the
chorus danced.—155. Res. A knight's ‘⁶ fortune” was required to be 400
sestertia—156. Lenonum pueri, they could sit in the fourteen rows be-
cause they had a property which entitled them so to do, and which they
procured often by practices not the most creditable.—Fornice, fornix
means “ an arch,” also “ a place arched over‚” οι· “ vaulted,” and from
the circumstance of low prostitutes mostly residing in vaalted cellars,
the word came to signify “ brothel'’ in general.

157. Plaudet, is here elegantly employed for sedeat. The frequenters
of the theatre used to “ applaud” both the performers, and the Emperors,
and also popular characters on their entrance. Comp. Hor. Od. l. 20.
3 and i.-Nicid2· praeconis, ‘⁶ of a spruce crier,” the epithet either al-
ludes to his shining with unguents and persumes‚ or to the general ele-
gance of his appearance, and hence it is the same as culti, which is the
consequence of his opulence.

158. Pinnirdpi, “ of the gladiator;” strictly speaking the pinnirapus
was the gladiator who was matched with the Samnite, and whose aim
it was to catch by a net the erest of the latter (hence he was also called
retiarius), which consisted of peacocks’ featlzcrs. The secutores (to
which class the Samnites belonged) were armed with a sword and
buckler to keep off the net of the retiarii, who, if they missed the erest
in throwing the net, instantly betook themselves to flight. The dress
of the retiarii was a short coat, with a hat tied under the chin by a
broad riband. They bore a trident in their left hand. The Threces,
originally Thracians, were armed with a falchion, and small round shield.
The Idirmillfines, (called also Galli, from their Gallic dress,) were much
the same as the secutores. They were, like them, armed with a sword,
and on the top of their head-picce‚ wore the figure of a fish embossed,
called μόρμυρος, whence their name. The Hoplomaclzi were completely
armed from head to foot, as their name implies. The Samnites, armed
like the Samnites, carried a large shield broad at the top, and growing
more narrow at the bottom, in order more conveniently to defend the
upper parts of the body. The essedarii generally fought from the 83εέ-
dum, or chariot, used by the ancient Gauls and Britons. The Anda-
ba‘toe, ἀναβάται, fought on horseback, with a helmet which covered and
defended their faces and eyes. The Bleridiani engaged in the after-
noon. The Postulatitii were men of great skill and experience, and as
such were generally produced only by the emperors. The F iscales
were maintained out of the emperors’ treasury‚ fiscus. The Dimaclzoeri
fought with two swords in their hands, whence their name—Lanistoe,
‘¹ of the sencing-master '¹ from laniare “to manglc‚’' as in a bloody
fight.

159. Sic libitum, dxc. “ such was the capricious pleasure of the silly
Otho, who thus made a distinction between us [i. e. regarding our
places in the theatre]”—- Vano ‘¹ little-minded,” “ weak‚” ‘⁶ indiscrimi-
nating ;’' as in his introduction of this law he had no eye to personal
merit, but merely took into consideration the wealth of individuals (rem
vanam atque inutilem). Otho rendered himself, by this law, exceed-
ingly unpopular with the commons‚ who considered themselves insulted
by such an enactment, and consequently hissed him when he appeared
in the theatre. The Equites, on the other hand, received him with
loud plaudits. The hissings of the one party, and the applause of the
