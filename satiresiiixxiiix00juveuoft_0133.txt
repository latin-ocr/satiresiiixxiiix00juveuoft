Mauro Oceano, the west, and that by the “ Ethiopians’' is meant the ex-
treme east of Africa, namely as sar as the Arabian Gulf. These were dif-
ferent from the Ethiopians who inhabited the western coast. beside the
Atlantic. By altos elephantos, Ruperti says, we are to understand India,
where the largest elephants are found. The ancient poets and geogra-
phers included Arabia and part of Egypt in India. Achaintre says,
that the interior of Africa is alluded to in the expression AEtlziopum
populos. Heinecke gives us the following paraphrase,-—-“ Not even was
Hannibal satiSfied with Africa although it is prodigious in extent; for
it is laved by the Mauritanian Ocean, is extended even to the Nile, and
moreover (mtrsus) reaches to AEthiopia where there are elephants of
huge dimensions ; in the phrase rursus ad we must supply extensa, taken
out of admota which precedes.”—Henninius aud others connect line
150 with the next, the meaning of which would be, “ Spain also is added
to the elephants of sEthiopia.'' Valesius conjectured versus for rursus
“towards Ethiopia and the land of elephants.’' Many editions have
aliosque elephantos, so that the expression would refer either to a differ-
ence between the ‘⁴ countries” of Libya, where the elephants existed, or
would imply a difference between the “elephants” οἱ Mauritania and
AEthiopia, or western and eastern AEthiopia. Plathner conjectures albos
for altos,- as Ptolemaeus informs us, that.“ near Libya was an extensive
region belonging to the AEthiopians where the elephants were all white.”
Facciolati explains rursus, i. e re—urs us-orsus; to mean “in the
opposite direction’' i. e. “Africa was hed on its< shore by the ocean, and
stretching on to the Nile, and in the opposite, i. e. the inland, quarter,
bordering on Mauritania,’' ἀο.

151. Imperiis, ‘⁶ to the (Punic) sway,'’ Hannibal conquered a portion
of Spain. It was first invaded by Amilcar and Asdrubal.—The Pyrenees
divide Spain from F rauce.

152. Transsth, “he springs over,’' rapidly surmounts.”—Opposuit
‘' placed in his way.'’—Alpcm, singular for plural, poetico more.

153. Diducit, “he splits.’' Livy tells us that Hannibal set fire to
large piles of trees, and poured vinegar on the rocks when thus heated,
which caused them to burst. There are two circumstances which ren-
derit probable that this story is fabulous: (1) Polybius does not say
a word on the subjectos the vinegar; and (2) he could scarcely have
procured trees enough on the barren summits of the Alps—Acetum, from
aceo, “to be tart,” as ἵξις from &dn—Rumpit, “ forces a way through.''
Compare Virg. viii. 76. Italioe,—Alpes immittit apertas.

154. Jam tenet Italiam, ‘¹ he now reaches,¹’ or “ gains possession of,
Italy.”

155. Actum, «bc. '¹ ‘We have done nothing‚’ says he‚” οὐδὲν (ἡμῖν)
‘22' 2⁸72!-

126. Vexillum pono, “plant our standard.'’ In the Roman army
the standard of the legion was properly called “ aquila.'’ those of the
-cohorts were in a special sense of the term called “ ἥρπαξ’ their hearers
being sique'ri, those of the manipuli, or smaller divisione of the cohort,
were denominated vexilla, and their bearers vexilnrii. But these dis-
tinctions were not always attended to.

157. O qualis, &m ⁴⁴ Oh what a face was his, and how splendidly
adapted for a caricature,'¹ ἁο.

158. Goetula belua, scil. an elephant—Luscum, “one-eyed.'' This
word is supposed to be derived from luce carens, or qu. lucise'cus, from
seco, or from ἀλιὸς, as fuscus, from φαιὸσς the third derivation is the
best, the first two being undoubtedly incorrect. Hannibal lost an eye
