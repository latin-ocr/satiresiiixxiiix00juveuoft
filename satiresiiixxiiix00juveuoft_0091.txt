SATIRE 111. 45

there that Bellerophon fell. Others make it refer to Crete ; others
to Thebes in Boeotia, and Helicon, on which Pegasus by a stroke of his
hoof formed the fount Hippocrene. Others understand Corinth, as being
the city where Bellerophon caught Pegasus. Dio Nicaeus makes Eg-
natius a native of Berytus in Phoem'cia‚ in which case the poet perhaps
alludes to some myth unknown to us.—Gor90nei pinna caballi may be
0, periphrasis for Peqasus, and then delapsa est will signify ‘¹ alighted.''
'Phe epithet Gorgonian is given to the steed, as sprung from the blood
of Medusa when slain by Pe seus.-—Caballus was properly “a packhorse ;
but it is used for any kind οξἿιοι-εθΡ By the use of the word here, how-
ever, Juvenal seems to deride the tale, or show his dislike to anything
Greek: it is the ιαβέλλης of the Greeks from „amcam—Penna is
the generic name for “ feather,’' and includes, as its species, pinnae
“ pinion-feathers,’¹ and plumae “ soft plumage.”

120. Ρτοιοᾳεηεε, &c.--The names here given are commonly con-
sidered fictitious; however there was a Protoyenes under Caligula, a
Greek informer, and there was a minion of Domitian called Diphilus.

121. Qui yentis vitio, dm. ‘⁴ Who, in accordance with the general
failing of his countrymen, never shares a person’s friendship with an-
other; but selfishly keeps it to himself.”—Qai refers only to the latter
noun Erimarchus, a phraseology not uncommon ; perhaps we may ac-
count for it here by assuming aut to be more completely disjunctive than
vel, and that it therefore makes the word which follows it more isolated.
In fact the distinction between vel—vel, and auu—aut is, that the former
two denote equal relations, with liberty of choice, or preference ; while
the latter two express absolute difference, so that if one thing be true
the other cannot be so. Sive—sive leave the reader at liberty to de-
termine the matter in his own mind, whether from the professed igno-
rance of the writer, or because the reference is to facts which may hap-
pen so that it is impossible to state anything definite with respect to
a particular case. In writing Latin composition it is important to know
the foregoing synonymes.—H‹zbet is a word often employed in re ama-
toria, and signifying ¹¹ to possess one's affections,'’ like ἔχω.

122. Nam quum, dte. “For when he has poured drop by drop into
his [the friend’s] ready ear, some little of his country’s and his nature's
envenomed detraction, ‹sm—Stillavit, Comp. Hor. Epist. 1. 8. 16.—
F aoilem “ credulous‚” ‘⁶ prone to believe,¹' the calumnies told him by the
Greek-Venenum. i. e. ¹⁴ calumny,” *a second nature with the Greeks,
unless perhaps Erimarchus was an African, and the words are used in
reference to the Massyloe fraudes, and bilinques insidias, mentioned
afterwards by Claudian.

124. Limine, i. e. from the patron's house—Perierunt. ‘⁸ have come
to nought,¹’ “ are consigned to oblivion‚‘' i. e. ‘¹ the old and faithful
client must give way to the new.”

125. Nzoeqmm, dvc. “ Nowhere is the casting-off,” “the throwing
overboard of a client less thought of [than at Rome].'' Jaccura is pro-
perly “ the throwing of goods overboard in a storm‚¹'—3166>.n.

126. Quod porro officium. dvc. ‘¹ Moreover,—not to flatter ourselves
[i. e. to tell the truthJ—how burdensome is the duty of the poor man.
or what reward has he after all, if he, poor wretch (toyatus) take pains to
run by night when even the Praetor urges the lictor, and hids him go in
all haste [to offer his respects to] the childless w'dows who are up and
dressed this long time.’' Or, Quod officium, dxc. ‘What opportunity of
showing attenti n, or of. deserving well [at the ha ds οἵ ‘his patron] has
the poor man ' '’ &c.-Quod for quale, and by implication quam one-
