xiv ON ROMAN SATIRE.

the Cyclops of Euripides, has escaped the wreek of Greek literature),
there were others called comico-satyrio, the compositions not of the
tragic, but of the comic poets, which is at once seen from the fact that
every Greek poet used only to cultivate ono species of poetry. When
the tragico-satyrio fables were now on the wane, the comico—satyrio still
fiourished, yet they are merely mentioned by their titles, no account
being given of their plot, and are classed under the general head of
“ Satyrs,'’ or comprised in the general class of comedyss* so that itis
difficult to state with precision in what the genius of the Greek comio
Satyr consisted, and in what respects it differed from the tragic. Eich-
staedt, however, marks four differences :—1st. The tragic poets took
the subject matter of their satyrio dramas (as they did also that of
their tragedies) from the mythic cycle; the comic poem, though they
did not reject altoyetlier such a subject, yet preferred in most instances
to draw their plots from every day-life; 2d. The tragic poets introduced
a chorus of Satyrs dancing; the comio writers either excluded them
utterly, or assigned their part to others3 3d. The scene of the tragic
Satyr was laid in the country; this was owing to their giving chief
characters to the Sileni and Satyrs; for those personageS‚ as well as their ·
president “Bacchus,'' were thought to be exclusively denizens of the
country. But greater license was allowed the comic poets; for, as they
had expelled the Satyrs from their eomposstions, there was nothing to
hinder them from transferring the scene from the country to the town ;
4th. The Tragion-Satyric fable. always formed the concluding piece of
a tetralogy‚ and, therefore, was never represented singly. The Comico-
Satyric were represented alone.

In the Satyric sables of the Greeks, prineipally in those of the
comic poets, and in their comedy, chiefly the old and middle, and in the
choruses of these, the custom of assailing citizens with abuse and in-
vective prevailed to an intolerable degree. For, by that celebrated
law passed by the Athenians against comedy, it was not tlte chorus, but
its license of indulging in insulting language, that was aholished ; then
those who had suffered beneath its lash, now refused to contribute any
longer to the defrayal of those enormous expensos, which the furnishing
of the chorus demanded. The consequence os this was. that during the
period of the middle comedy. the choral songs, formerly accompanied by
music and dancing, were entirely si1cneed; bnt the chorus still existed,
which merely, however, delivered speeches with appropriate action.

Not only were the ‹ir-amatio poenis of Greece fraught with the same
spirit os satire as the satyrio fabios. but even the Epic also (as, sor iu—
stance, the Μαργίτης, which is salsely ascribed to Homer), the Iyric or
iambic (as Areliiloclius.† (see llor. Epis. ad I‘is. 79.) and Hipponax
who invented the scazon iambie. a specimen os which Persius gives in
his prologue), the didactic (ns the poeni of Simonides, on the manners
os women), and the Σίλλοι οι· Σιλλοὶ, abusive poenis. which received their
name, not from the Σιλιίνοι, but from σίλλων or σιλλαίυιιν. “ to move the
eyes in a contemptuous manner. and so to satirize.'’ These last have
been written by Timon, a native of Phlius. in the nge os Ptolemy Philad„
