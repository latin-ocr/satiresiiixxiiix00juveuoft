SATIRE x. 77

‘¹ The Emperor’s wrath is violently kindled ;” (2) “Maynum est in-
cendium, h. e. res maximi excidii et furoris moventur,” Britannicus;
that is “ fiery destruction is on foot.’' The oppositiou between magma
and fornacula is worthy of note.—Pallid1dus “ looking palish‚’' “ rather
pale.’' scil. from his apprehension of the death he was about to meet.

83. Brutidius Niyer, an AEdfle, of some repute as a rhetorician and
historiam—Meus ; the reader will recollect that it is one of the people
who is speaking; Brutidius was an intimate friend of Sejanus, whose
interests when alive the people favoured [76]; it was when 011 his way
to death that Brutidius niet the narrator.—Ad iliarda—Aram “of
Mars‚” scil. the Avenger, whose temple was in the forum of Augustus.
The word Mars is analogous to the Greek Ἄρης, being derived from
Mas, as Ἀςης from ε’έῤῥην, whence the original signification must have
been “ the manly,” ‘⁴ the powerful.'' D’orleans conjectures ad Marcis
fuyit ocyus aram, scil. to find protection there.

84. Quam timeo, ὼε. “ How I dread that this baffled Ajax may
wreak his vengeance [on us all], as having been but inadequately vin-
dicated,” or “poorly supported.”—By Ajax, Tiberius is meant. The
story that Ajax, son of Telamon, slaughtered the sheep, when the Greeks
had not supported him in his application for the arms of Achilles, is too
well known to be inserted here. The poet, no doubt, gives the Romans
a side-blow sor their supineness and disgraceful want of spirit in allow-
ing themselves to be butchered like sheep by their enraged tyrant. We
are told by Suetonius that Tiberius, after Sejanus’ death vented his
fury, like a wild beast, against every class of the citizens. The inter-
pretation of this sentence which formerly fidem habebat is as follows :—
“ How I sear that Brutidius and the other citizens defeated by the in-
formers on their trial, or condemned, and ill defended in consequence
of the judges being corrupted, may inflict that punishment on themselves
which they dread to receive at the hands of the Emperor ;’' or “ endure,’'
“carry out to the end,'’ (εωίραηκ) i. e. commit suicide, like Ajam in-
deed we are informed by Suetonius that in many cases sels-destruction
took place. But this explanation does not square with the context, and
is moreover decidedly erroneous as regards the phrase exiycmt poenas,
which always meam, ‘⁴ to take vengeance at the hands of another,'’ and
is constructed either with a dative or an ablative with ab. The literal
import of the words is easy of explanation by the fact that poena origin-
ally consisted of a fine (ποινὴ) in cattle or money.

85—86. C terramus, &c. An excellent representation is here given of
the slavish rabble that “ follows fortune,'’ and also of those times when
slaves informed on their masters—Hostem, scil. Sejanum.—Calcemus,
namely to show our detestation of the man ; thus λὰξ ἰν στήθεσι βαίνω,
ῘῘΟῙΠ. Il. r. 618. Compare also ingoa’m ἔτεμβῆναι τοδὶ, and θανόντι
πεοσεμβῆναι, Soph. Electra and Ajax. Hence orm-sf- is used for κατα-
φςοηῖν in Anacreon and Aristoph. Equit.

87. At Servi videam, “let our slaves see us, i. e. ‘⁶ that we trample
on Sejanus' body, lest they swear information against us, as having been
his friends.'‘ In cases of high treason and incest only, the testimony
of slaves against their owners was admissible; and in such cases free-
dom, instead of a pecuniary reward, was conferred upon them. In
order to obtain this, however, slaves often swore falsely against their
lords, in the reign of Tiberius, Domitian, &c. on which account Nerva
pssublished an edict debarring them from the privilege of laying informa-
tion in any case.
