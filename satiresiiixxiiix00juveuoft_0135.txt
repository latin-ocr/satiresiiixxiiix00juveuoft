SATIRE x. 89

170. Gyarae was an island in the AEgean, one of the Cyclades, hod.
Calairo, or Coloiera, or rather Jura, situated between Andros and
Cea. Malefactors were banished thither in the time of the Emperors,
as it was a most bleak and rugged isle—Seriphos one of the Cyclades,
hod. Serfino, about 12 miles in circumference.

171. A Fiyulis. ‘⁴ The city fortified by brick-makers,” (κεραμεύῃ)
was Babylon, which Semiramis is said to have surrounded with a wall of
brick (muro e cocco latere).—A1exander died here B.c. 323.

172. Sarcophdyo, Σαρκοφιέγος, was the name of a peculiar kind of
stone, (found in veins at Assos, a promontory of Troas,) which was said
to consume the flesh of bodies deposited therein, in the space of forty
days. Alexander’s body was interred by Ptolemy at Alexandria in a
golden coffin, and it may be interesting to the reader to know, that the
‘¹ Sarcophagus,'’ in which the coffin was enclosed, is now in the British
Museum, and has been there since 1802. Dr Clarke obtained it in
Egypt, where he found it in the possession of French soldiers, and he
has written an essay upon it which effectually proves its genuineness.

173. Quantula, (bc. “ How insignificantly great are the puny bodies
of men.'’—Credz'tur olim, dzc. ⁴¹ Athos is believed to have been for-
merly sailed through, and everything else that lying Greece dares to
record in history, namely‚ that the sea was covered,” dic. Juvenal en,
passam makes a hit at the foolish and absurd tales which the Greek
writers recounted concerning Xerxes, and the object of which was to
give a high notion of their countrymen's valour. Thus, they said that
Xerxes' infantry amounted to seven millions, and his ficet to one hundred
thousand vessels; that through Athos, an excecdingly high mountain of Ma-
cedonia, (a peninsula, hod. monce Samo), a canai was cut, through which
his fleet passed; that deep rivers (17 6) were drunk up by the army at a
meal ; that the whole sea was, as it were, paved over (constratwn) by
his fleet, forming a road to walk on, and that a bridge was thus formed
across the Hellespont over which his chariots drove (suppositum rotis).
—C'onsm-atzmz, naroeaeaegmssz'v,—the flumina were the Scamander, the
Onochonus, the Apidanus, and the Echedorus.--The ‘⁶ Meclc'⁷ may
mean either the Asiatic hosts, or Xerxes king of the Mcdes and Per-
sians.-Prandente. The prandium was a luncheon taken about 12 or 1
o'clock in the day: derived from πρὰν, from πρωί, “in the morning.''
Before we quit this part of the sentence it may be well to state, that
Ruperti would prefer the reading [acus sor amnes in 177, in order, as
he says, to prevent the tautology in ammes and flumina, and because
Herodotus tells uS, that Xerxes’ army not only drank up four rivers,
but also a lake thirty stadia in extent.

178. Madidis—alis. Concerning the interpretation of these words
there has been no little dispute. Perhaps the preferable mode is to
translate them “with moist arm-pits‚'' the allusion in which will be to
the great exertions of this Sostratus in the recitation of his writings
- causing him to perspire; thus, Hor. “sudor ad imos manabat talos.'’
Others, however, interpret them as signifying that poetic saror or frenzy,
which excites the writer as though with wine, and, as in the case of
Sostratus, causes him to exceed the bounds of truth and fidelity. Others,
again, refer the expression to real drunkenness, to which they contend
Sostratus was prone. Certainly madidus and madiens (Greek βεβρεγμίνος)
are often used in the sense of ebrius. According to the second and
third interpretations, the translation of the words will be simply “ with
moistened wings,'’—or ‘⁴ Sostratus sings in his tipsy flights.'’ Nothing
