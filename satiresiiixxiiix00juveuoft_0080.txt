34 sorss 01«v JUVENAL.

out‚” is opposed to conducere, “to rent,'' “hire.’‘-Delubrum (gen-

erally used in the plural), was properly ‘⁶ the innermost part of a tem- ”
ple, in which the image of the deity stood ;” hence, ‘⁶ the sacred habi-
tation of the deity‚''—AEdes was the dwelling-place of a deity, consi-
dered as a building: templum, the whole space of ground connected with
the building, and especially the building itself: sanum, the temple and

its precincts in general, with the idea of sanctity and dedication; it ³

nearly corresponds to our word “ sanctuary,'’ and so, when it is used in
the singular, it always has the name of a deity joined with it.

14. Judaeis. The Jews were expelled from the city, first by Claudius,
and afterwards by Domitiam but it was soon full of them again. The
grove of the Muses was let out to them at a certain yearly rent, which.
as Suetonius says, was rigorously exacted by Domitian. Hence Juvenal
satirizes both the impiety of the emperors in deseerating and raising
money from places hallowed by religion, and also their cupidity in
taxing persons so poor as to be possessed only of “ a basket and hay.”
—The cophinus κόφινος, was a wicker basket, used by the Jews, in
their journeys through the heathen nations, to carry their provisions in,
and so to keep them from pollution.—The soenum was either to serve
as a bed to lie upon, or to seed their beasts of burden ; but the latter
view seems forbidden by a consideration of their poverty, which must

have incapacitated them from possessing such anima1s; some think that ,

they used it to stop the holes in their basketS. The first interpretation
appears to be most correct: compare Sat. vi. 542. Cophino sanoque ’
relicta—Arcanum Judoea tremens mendicat in aurem—supellex is
derived either from super lecto, or sub pellibus—15. Mercedem, μεθῶ.
-16, Some write Camenis with a diphthong e. g. Camaenis, but without
authority, as the origin of the word is unknown, (the common deriva-
tion a cantu amoeno being absurd), and the old copies have e simply.—
17. Speluncas, used here for antra, as spelunca (στήλυγξ), and specus
(nias) signify properly. ‘⁴ a deep holo or pit,'' a cavern, while antrum ·
is ·‘ a grotto.’'-—-18. Dissimiles veris, so changed by artificial embellish-
mentS, that they have lost every appearance of nature : 'compare below ἶ
inqenuum tophum violarent.

18. Quanto, ake„ “how much better would be the sacred spring. ir
grass enclosed the waters with a bank of green verduro.'' Heinsius,
following Le Grange would read praesentius‚ ⁴· lIow much more propiti
ous would be the divinity of the spring. '' etc.. because the gods wer ι
