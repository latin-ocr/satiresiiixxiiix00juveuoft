magistrates peculiar to themselves, to be elected from their own body,-
who should have power to protect them from the oppression of the
senate and their creditors. These were the tribuni plebis. At first
there were two of them: in the year 283, five: although from the
very first, the two tribunes chose three colleagues; in the year 297, ten:
and at this number they remained.

314. Carcere. This prison was built by Ancus Marcius, in the mid-
dle of the city, nigh the forum. Servius Tullius added a dungeon,
called from him Robur Tullianum. Appius Claudius, the decemvir.
built the next prison.— Uno carcere, “ with a single prison.”

315. Poteram subnectere, “ I could subjoin.”—Causas, scil. for quit-
ting the city.

316. Jumenta, ὑποζύγια, quasi juvamenta from javo‚-—the mules, which
had now advanced to a distance on the road, warned Umbricius to be
moving.—Eundam est, “ I must be gone.’'

317. Nam mihi, disc. ‘⁴ For this long time the muleteer is giving me
a hini: by smacking his whip.”

318. Et, quocies te, dvc. ‘⁶ And as oft as Rome will restore you to your .

native Aquinum, as you hasten [thither] to recruit yourself, tear me also
from Cumae to Helvine Ceres and your Diana.‘’—Aquinum was the
native place of Juvena1‚—vid. his life.

320. Helvinam, a word of doubtful origin. Some think that Ceres
was thus named from aluo, “to wash off,” as those who were about to
be initiated in her sacred rites had to be washed; others from the
yellow (helvas) colour of the ears of corn ; others from a fountain near
Aquinum, called “ Helvine.’' The old scholiast explains the origin of
the name thus: “ because‚’‘ he says, “at Aquinum they worship the
same goddesses as they do among the Gauls ;” he therefore seems to
think that the word is from Helvii, a people of Gaul. Of these. tho
second is to be preferred, for heluus is the same as selvas, i. e. fulvus.
identical with flavus, and flava is the usual epithet of Ceres.

320. Satiramtm, dcc. ‘¹ Armed I shall come into your eool plains, as
an assistant to your satires, unless they are asliained ¹⁴ of my poor aid.”
—Gelidos, on account of the hilis, woods, and streams about Aquinum:
In Campania, on the contrary, the air was much warnier.—-322. Cali-
flatus, lit. “wearing the caliqa, or military bootff' llere it probably
means, “as a soldier,'’ “as a keen enemy of vice.''
