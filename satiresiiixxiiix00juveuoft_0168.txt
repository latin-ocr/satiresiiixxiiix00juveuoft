122 noras on JUVENAL.

4. Si damnosa, ἁο. “ If ruinous gambling delights the old man (i, e.
the father), his heir too plays, though wearing the bulla, and shakes the
same implements in his tiny dice-box.”—Alea signified properly gaming,
or playing at a game of chance of any kind. Playing with tali, or
tesseroe, was generally understood; because this was by far the most
common game of chance among the Romans. Gambling was forbidden
, by the Roman laws, both during the times of the republic and under
the emperors (vetica leyibus alea, Hor. Od. 3. 24.) To detect and
punish excesses of this description belonged to the office of the AEdiles.
Games of chance were, however, tolerated in the mouth of December
at the Saturnalia, which was a period of general relaxation; and
among the Greeks, as well as the Romans, old men were allowed to
amuse themselves in this manner. Alea sometimes denotes the imple-
ment used in playing, as in the phrase “jacta alea> est‚'‘ uttered by
Julius Caesar immediately before he crossed the Rubicon; and it is
often used for “ chance'’ or “ uncertainty'’ in general.

5. Bullatus, see 13, 33.—Fritillo, the fritillas (φῖμος) was a dice-
box of a cylindrical form, and therefore called also by Martial turricula.
and formed with parallel indentations (qr-adim) ou the inside, so as to
make a rattliug noise when the dice were shaken in it. When games
of chance became general among the Romans, so that even boys en-
gaged in them, they had fritilli ‘⁴ smalP’ in proportion to their age.
Ruperti, in his remarks on fritillas, seems to contradict himself; sor
he gives pyryus and turriczda as synonymes for fritillas, while he pro-
ceeds to say that the tali and tcsscroe (the arma of this line) were shaken
in the fritillas, and were then thrown upon the table by means of the
pyryus or turricula, which is rank nonsense; but perhaps he foi-got to
say alium pyryum, Fricillus is a diminutive offritizmus, an old word.

6. Nec melius, ἀο. “ Νοι· will that. youth allow any relation to cherish
better expectations of himself (the juvenis), who has learned to serape
truffles, to pickle mushroonw, and to souse fig-peckers floating in the
same sauce, while his prodigal parent, even a lioary glutton, sets him
the example.”-Melius either, the juvenis who has learned. ἀρ. will
give no better hopes of himself. than the son of the father who was
addicted to gaming, or will afford no better hopes of himself than of his
parent.-— Tubero εει-ηε, ὃδιαι. The Boletus was the finest species os
mushroom. It was in a dish of these that Agrippina gave her husband
Claudius the poison with which Locusta had presented hen—Fice-
dfflas. F ig-peckers were esteemed a great delicacy. It was the only
bird of which epicuros allowed the whole to be caten. In the trans-
lation of the clause in which the word ocem-s, we have adopted the
meaning of meryere which Gifford preferred. We have also been
accustomed to hear it thus rendered; the appearance of tautology in
merqere natantes being no obstacle. For the latter words simply
mean, as Gifford expresses it, “to sousc them till they swim;” pre-
cisely analagous to Virgil's scuta Ιαίιίιίὶα condunt. Ruperti, however.
explains mer-gyara bv dnum-are i. e. “to l›olt” as they were swallowed
whole.—-Cand yulci, literally “the hoary gullet:'' so ‘yses-‘gu ἆςγιΐ
(literally, ¹‘ slow bellies,'') means ‘¹ lazy gluttons.'' (Tit. l. 1⁸2.)

12. Bar-batos. dxc. “though you should place a thousand bem-ded
suges on one side of him,'' dc. The philosophers, by way of respect.
were called barbati. The Stoica and Cynics particularly wore their
beards long. Although, says Juvenal. you had a thousand Cynics on
the one side. and a thousand Stoics on the other, to instil their inaximo of
tempe-rauce into the beart os the youth: yet the bey, having got an early
