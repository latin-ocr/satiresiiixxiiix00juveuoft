SATIRE XIV. 129

eleans out these with 3 single half-bushel of saw-dust.”⁸ Scobs or
scobis (πρίσματα) was the dust that falls down in filing, sawing, rasping,
or bol-ing. ‘¹ Saw—dust‚'’ says Stocker, ‘⁶ was probably used among the
Romans (as it is now in the shops of London) for laying the dust, while
the dirt was swept away.” Perhaps they used it, as we use sand in
strewing stone or brick floors. Heliogabalus was said to strew his
gallery with gold dust.

68. Illud non ayz'tas. “ Do you 1101 make it the subject of your study,
11131 your son should see his home pure without any moral defilement,
and perfectly free from vice.’' ,

70. Gratum. “ Thank-worthy,'’ scil. that you gave 3 son to your
country.—P‹1triae populoque “to the state and the people.’' Bentley
proposed the reading patribus civem populoque dedisti, in order to
avoid 1101 only the tautology (which he considers to exist in patriae
populoque), but also the inelegant repetition of patrioe in the next
line. But Ovid (Met. 15, 572) has joined the same words, as we have
them in the text ; and there is no tautology in them, patriae referring
to the whole commonwealth with all its constituent parts, the majesty,
dignity, and security of the public at large, while populo refers merely
to 1118 citizens.

'‘Il‘. Patriae idoneus, ἀο. “beneficial 10 his native city, serviceable
to its rural districtS.’⁹—A9ris scil. colendis,—we may render it “ agri-
culture.”

73. Plurimum, ἁο. “ For 11 will make a vast differ-enee, in what
practices <or ⁴· accomplishments,'') and habits you train him up.'’

74—85. Even the examples of the inferior animals teach us that
those things which have been instilled into the mind in early years, and
by the parent, are indelibly impressed thereon.

74. Sei-pente, &C- “ The stork feeds her young with serpents, and
with lizards, which she has found amid the devians brakes.” Valesius
says, that perhaps the Ibis is here meant (comp. Sat. 15, 3), but the
allusion may as well 118 10 1118 common stork ;—Devius, ‘⁴ that leads out
of the way, invius,” in which there is no road or way, “ avius,” that is
remote from a way,” and so is “ on one side of the way.”

76. Sumtis pinnis. ‘⁶ When they have taken wing,’' i. e. when they
have come to maturity.

77. Vultur, dte. “ The vulture, fresh from carrion and dogs and the
relies of the gibbet, hastes to her brood,” ‹ka—Crucibus relictis ,· many
make relictis a noun, and consider crucibus to be governed by in, but
this is decidedly erroneous ; relictis agrees with crucibus, and the phrase
signifies literally “the gibbets that remain,’¹ i. e. the remainder of
the gibbets ; an exact parallel occurs in Livy, book 3d, Ch. 23, where
exercita relicto means “ the rest of the army ;'’ the commentators on
which passage, not perceiving the proper meaning, have proposed con-
jectura! emendations.

79. Maqni vulturis. “ Of the vulture when full-grown.”

80. Proprid arbore, “ on a tree of her own,” i. e. on 3 tree which she
appropriates toherself. Vultures build their nests on lofty and inacces-
sible rocks ; but examples are 1101 wanting of their building on trees.

81. Sed leporem, &a “ While J ove’s handmaidens, even those noble
birds, pursue the hare or roe along the wooded hilis: prey of this sort

*- Others explain the clause beginning with et tamen uno thus, you are so
anxious about these things which, however, can be so easily cleaned, that one
slave (in scouring and scraping them all) can scarcely get half-a-bushel of dust
off them. Some read emendat.
