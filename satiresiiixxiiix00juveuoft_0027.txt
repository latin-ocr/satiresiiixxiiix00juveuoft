on ROMAN sA'rIRE. xix

mus or optumus, &e.,) by the latter satyra. Some think that it was from
saturitas, alluding to the abundance ormam-ix* Others derive it from
satu-r in the sense of “ sated, inebriated‚⁷’ as in this composition there
is freedom and severity of expression, such as indulgence in wine pro-
duces. Others deduce it from the Satyri, because the character of the
subject, and of the language, is such as is befitting to those petulant and
rude beings. Others from lex satura, i. e., a law which contained many
and different subjects. Others from lana· satura, a charger or tray on
which it was customary to offer the gods of the first-fruits of the pro-
duce—aedynoegoros θυσία, or πανσπερμία. Thus the etymology of the word
arises from the application of the word satura's to whatever contained
a variety of things, and in its composition this variety was either in the
subject, metres, or in a union of poetic and prosaic language. The three
most ancient species of satire correspond with this last derivation, which
J uvenal's words seem also to confirm, “ Quidquid agunt homines, votum,
timor, ira, voluptas, gaudia, discursus, nostri est farrago libelli ;” Sat.

Casaubon and those others who define satire to be a composition
whose subject is set forth in a medley οι· mixture of different vices and
general matters, seem to have looked more to the force and etymology
of the word than to the mixture of the poem itself. Julius Caesar Sca-
liger, Heinsius, &c. have given too much weight to the resemblance
between the words Satyrice, Satyri, and Satyra; for, even though the
term were exclusively of the Greek origin, yet satura would be the
correct orthography‚ and not Satyra or Satira; for the ancient Romans
pronounced the Greek ὁ like the short u of the French. The gram-
marians substituted the letter y for v, and for y persons of inferior
learning substituted i, thus inclytus, and inclitus, lacrymae and lacrimae
are sor inclutus and lacrfimae. But it is more probable that not only
the composition itself, but also its title, or at least the application of the
latter, took its rise among the Romans, than among the Greeks. The
testimony of Horace and Quintilian are direct upon this point; the
former calls Ennius (as we said above) “ rudis et intacti Groecis car—
minis auct0r‚'' Sat. 1. 10, 933 the latter says (as before quoted) “ satira
:ron est nosrns,” Inst. Or. 10. 1, 93. Now the testimony of these
men of antiquity is far more worthy of credit than the uncertain con-
jectures of moderns (as Jul. Scaliger) however learned; further, the
Greeks had no word derived from the Satyrs, which expressed th·t
name of any composition like the Roman satires‚ the word σατυςὶζειν
meaning to act with wantonness, conduct in which the Satyrs were
represented as often engaging ; and indeed there was never any single
species of poem or verses among the Greeks, to which the characteris-
tics of the Ennian, and, above all, the Lucilian satire belonged ; but ou
the contrary, a great difference would be discovered on compa1·ison.‡

*ἓ Saturitas comes for the Greek σάτοςες or troeoe²40301‚'u*hich, according to Hesy-
chius is used by the Lacedaemoniam to signisy σκάφάι βας-ζωῶν, “vessels full of gmpesff·

† The ancients, when they were offering to Ceres, Bacchus, or the other deities
of the country, annual thanksgivings sor favourable harwsts, used to present first-
fmits of different kinds, all heaped on a dish, to each divinity according to the
method of his worship. Such a medley of offerings was called by the Greeks
ra'yzxgaeog θυσίαι and πανσπκςμίω, also πυανίαι 01* πυανεψίαι, When it consisted of pulse.
The Latius called dishes thus filled with various things lances saturoe, or simply
saturae; for they employed satur to designate that which was full, and had no
deficiency‚—thus color satur is a perfect colour.

Greeks no definite name which marked that species of composition in which the
