xxxiv REMARKS on· THE smnus or

fictitious, all the composition must be suited to the disposition, manners,
times and circumstances, not only of the author, but also of the indivi-
dual to whom it is addressed. There is nothing of this diseernible in
the satires; for, even if they he inscribed to any person, yet the inscrip-
tion only serves as a dedication, and does not affect the handling of the
subject. But the same epistle, which has a fixed and unvarying form,
is found in its subject-matter varied and shifting; for the materials
and variety of the latter are bounded by no limits save those which
distinguish poetry from prose. Because, whatever furnishes materials
for common epistolary communications (except those which from their
nature do not admit of a poetical dress), may be employed by the writer
of poetical epistles. These last may be divided into three classes; 1.
Didactic; 2. Elegiac; 3. Sportive. To the didactic belong the moral 01·
ethical epistles, such as Horace wrote. Their scope is to teach and
instruct individuals, to inculcate virtuous principle-⁶³, and to stimulate
the practice of virtue. Now, although the satire comes near these
moral epistles, and particularly so in Horace' case, who reproves vices
with such gentle courtesy, and who has with such judgment blended
praises of what is good with light censure of what is evil; yet all the
force of the satire does not turn upon instruction and admonition‚ but
upon ridicule and censure; since its aim is to note, reprove, and chas-
tise either the disgrace attendant upon the commission of the more
heinous vices, 01· the folly attendant upon the more trivial. And hence
arise two species of satire; 1. the sprightly and pleasant, such as
Horace wrote ; 2. the grave and austere, as those of Juvenal and
Persius. As the subject-matter of the poems is different, so also is
their style of language and mette. Thus in his epistles Horace dis-
plays the gravity of a philosopher, of a man who studied true wisdom.
In his satires he exhibits the levity of a comic writer, such as is to be
looked for from a young] poet, who took pleasure in those festive enjoy-
ments which were suited to his years. In his epistles the metre is more
strictly in accordance with regular rules than in his satires. We find in
the epistles not only the seeds of the Socratic philosophy scattered here
and there; but also that fascinating and mild method of disputation 011
subjeets of morality or duty, which characterizes Socrates. or at- least his
· pupils.” We are also infor-med by the same author, that the epistle to the
Pisos, especially, contains imitations os Plato, and that the aim os this
production was to resute the then prevalent judgment respecting poeti-y.
by imparting instruction at 0110 time jocularly, at another in serious lan-
guage: also, to reprovc both those scribblers who attempt poetry without
the requisito genius and learning, and those who favour them: whatever
else is introduced is merely cpisodic.

Resides tho dramatic form of some satires. os which we have spoken
before, there is a peeuliar feature which is no less pleasing than original
in Horaee' invention and arrangement of his subjects. which. however,
seems to be rather the effect os carelessness than of art. Availing
