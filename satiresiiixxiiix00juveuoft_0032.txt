A BRIEF ACCOUNT

OF THE

ROMAN SATIRIC POETS.

Is the former treatise we have shown that the Satura, or Satira of th:
Romans, had two distinct branches, i. e., the Dramatic and Didactir
We shall now briefly mention those poets who respectively followed
each, and, therefore, either versified different plots and characters, ov.
