SATIRE 111. 51

Valesius reads Veneto, ⁴⁶ Venetian‚'’ but though we have mention in the
Latin writers of “ Aretian, Surrentine and Saguntine bowls ;'’ we hear
nothing of any especially called Venetiam—The Czclullus, (qu. culeolus,
a dimin. from Galeas, κουλεᾶς, which denotes ‘⁴ a vessel'' used for different
purposes) was a large bowl with handles, at first made of earth, but
afterwards even of gold. The old editions read cucullo “ a hood,” a
covering for the head and shoulders worn by men and women, and in
that case veneto is explained as “ sky-blue ;'' but Juvenal is talking of
suppers and of earthen-ware (fictilibus) bow1s‚ and does not yet refer to
articles of dress. The leading idea contained in les—170 is, that at
Rome people were ashamed of living in a frugal and economical man-
ner, but in the country matters were quite different in that respect.

171. Pars magma, ὣς. Umbricius now satirizes the extravagance of
the Romans in their dress. This is a new reason for leaving the city.
“ In other parts of Italy,” says he, “ no attire is seen inconsistent with the
means of each individual. In the borough towns they scarcely put- on the
toya at all (much less such gorgeous ones as are seen here), but content
themselves with the tunic.” The toya was the dress of ceremony, worn
by the poor, when they paid their respects to the rich : it was also the
dress of business. The tunica, which was the usual dress in the country,
was less cumbersome. In Italy the dead were covered with the coya,
as in Greece with the palliam. The Censors were covered with one of
purple ; the chief magistrates with the proetexta ; citizens of respectable
rank with the toya candida (i. e. one of a bright white), and persons of
the lower class with one of no great value.

17 2. Ipsa dierum, avo. “ Even when the solemnity of the festal days
is being celebrated in the grassy theatre.’'-Herboso‚ i. e. constructed
of sods ; but Ferrarius sees no reason why theatro may not signify here
a regular theatre‚ in which case herboso must mean ‘⁶ overgrown with
grass,'’ on account of the infrequency of scenic representations, which
also the words si quando may imply.

174. Tandem, ‘⁴ at length,'’ namely at the end of the year, or “ at the
conclusion of the serious play.'’—Palpita, ῤ’ the stage,’' Mysiam—Notum
“ oft-repeated‚’' “ familiar,’' marking the simplicity of the people, as
compared with the Romans who introduced novelties frequently.

175. Exodiwn, “ The farce‚'' which was enacted after the play (es-
pecially the Atellan play) to dispel melancholy impressions. The εἷσόδια
were performed at the beginning, and the ἔμβολα “ interludes‚’' in the
middle of the drama. Emodium may here, however, refer to “the farce
performer.'’

176. Quam, dxc. “ when the rustic baby, lying in its mother's lap,
shudders at the wide—yawning mouth of the ghastly mask.'' By this the
poet intends to satirize that absurd and shocking style of masks which
in his time was prevalent. In the Atellan plays, particularly, there were
hobgoblins exhibited (mandavi, μορμολύκεια), with countenances of hid-
eous deformity‚ and with gaping mouths (hiantia). The wide mouths of
the masks were partly intended to aid the voice—Pallantis, as being
painted of a ghastly colour. The word formidat is here used in its
strictest acceptation: for, being derived from forma “a spectre,'' or
‘¹ [dread] appearance,’¹ it properly denotes the sensation of sear or dread
occasioned by some external object.

177. AEquales habitus, “the [spectators] dresses of a uniform sort.”
—Illic‚ scil. in country towns.— S imilesque Orchestram et populum,
“the Senators and lower orders in similar attire.” orchestram-see
note on 155. The rustic theatres had no orchestra ; the word here
