smmis xiv. 143

watched temple of Castor,‘' lit, “with the sieepless,’‘,or “vigilant
Castor.'‘ Compare 10, 24. This expression alludes either to the
custom of placing money in the temples for security‚ or placing it in
the hands of the Mensarii, or “ banke1·s‚” a class of which persons were
appointed by the go'vernment to receive deposits. These persons were
stationed in the forum, and were consequently “near the temple of
Castor ;” and if this last view be adopted the words of the tent must
be so rendered. The epithet viyil alludes to the circumstance of this
temple being guarded by soldiers at night.

261. Ex qao. ‘⁶ Ever since.'’—Mars. Some thieves broke into the
temple of Mars, which was in the forum of Augustus, and not only
carried off the money which was there lodged, but also the helmet of
the god's statue. Augustus had erected this temple to “Mars the
Avenger'' on his return from his Asian expedition. There is great
sarcasm in J uvenal’s tet-ming him “ avenger'' here, whereby he throws
ridicule upon the weakness of their deity, and upon the Romans for
their foolish credulity in believing that Mars, who could not even
“ guard his own effects‚” could guard those of others which were com-
mitted to his protection, and this, too, being the progenitor and patron
of the Roman nation. Rigaltius was of opinion that in thus deriding
Mars and sarcastically terming him Ultor, Juvenal conveys an in-
sinuation of the Romans being cowards; as they sought nothing more
than arms, and yet they often suffered themselves to be disgracefully
deprived of them.

262. Eryo, dte. You need· not frequent places of public entertain-
ment ; you will have infinitely more amusement in observing the various
proceedings of the avaricious.

263. Florae licet aalaea relinquas. “you may leave the games of
Flora‚'’ dte. The Floralia were solemnized during five days, begin-
ning on the 28th of April, and ending on the 2d of May. They
were first instituted at Rome in 238 ΒΕ. by the command of an
oracle in the Sybilline books. The Cerealia were celebrated in honour
of Ceres, whose wanderings in search of her lost daughter were repre-
sented by women, clothed in white, running about with lighted torches.
During its continuance games were celebrated in the Circus Maximus,
the spectatore of which appeared in white. The day of the Cerealia is
doubtful ; some think it was the ides or thirteenth of April, others the
seventh of the same mouth.—The “ games of Cybele” were held on the
third day of the festival called Meyalesz'a, which was celebrated in
honour of the mother of the gods· These games were purely scenio,
and not Circenses. They were first held ou the Palatino in front of
the temple of the goddess, but afterwards also in the theatres. The
festival lasted for six days, beginning on the fourth of April. The
regular celebration of the Illeyalesia at Rome began in 191 B.C.—

264. Tanto, dxc. “ So much greater themes of amusement are the
various proceedings of mankind,'’ or “real life.”

265—284. Here the folly of the avaricious is shown, who encounter
all dangers to heap up countless wealth, by the poet comparing them
with persons who are compelled to risk their lives merely to obtain the
neeessaries of lisa—An mayis, dvc„ can feats of dangerous agility per—
formed by tumblers and rope-duncers afford greater entertainment than
your conduct, Ο votary of Avarice, in tempting the perils of the ocean,
and that too without any necessity, but simply from a love for use-
less riches.—-Jactata petauro, the pelaarum (en'wugov, πίτευςον, from
