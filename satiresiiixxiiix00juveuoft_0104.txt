‚ 58 noras on JUVENAL.

moral. Some however maintain that κυάμων should not¹ be rendered ⁴
¹⁶ beans? but ‘¹ eyysss’ from which they were to refrain, as containing
the seeds of existence. « ,-

230. Est aliquid, dvc. “ It is something for a person to have consti-
tuted himself the owner of a single lizard in any place of retirement

whatsoever.''—-Est aliquid, Gr. ἰπὶ τμ-Ιᾷασενεω, This word has given ·
great trouble to the Commentators. Brittanicus renders it, ‘⁴ of a tiny ¹

worm‚” i. e. of even the smallest or most trifling article. Achaintre
understands it to refer to a low cottage or narrow hole such as a lizard
might be supposed to lurk in. Farnabius, Grangaeus aud others, under·
stand it to mean a very small field or garden, where hardly one lizard
could conceal itself and run about. Some say that lacertoe is here used
in the sense of lacerti, (or that the latter should be the reading) in which
case the meaning would be “ as much ground as the arm from the shoulder
to the elbow (lacertus) would reaeh over.'' Bahrdt thus paraphrases,
“ the master of as much as a strong arm could till.'' Heinsius feels
confident that lacerti is the correct reading, and translates it ¹‘ of a low·
priced fish.” Schrader agrees with Heinsius. Others are of opinion
that the reading should be latebrae, or lacernae, the latter of which
Valesius explains thus ; where a person might be clad with the lacerna
without restraint, and not be forced to encumber himself with the long
coya as at Rome. Ruperti is satisfied with none of the above explana-
tions, but is inclined to think that Juvenal wrote tabernae, i. e. casae (as
in Horace tabernas pauperum et obscuras) and that quocumque is not
for quovis, but for qualicunque. The simplest explanation is that of
Farnabius, with which Dr Johnson agreed, scil. as much ground as one
may be likely to find a lizard on—this would not be a great deal in Italy
where the lizards abounded : Lacerta is the Gr. σαῦροι.

232. Viqilando, “ by want of sleep.’'—Hic, scil. At Rome—Sed il-
lum tanqum-em, ὣς. “But even that malady has been engendered by
food not properly dressed, and consequently clogging the feverish sto-
mach.'’—Impe1sectus is generally translated ‘⁴ indigested;'’ but that is
rather the consequence of the food being imperfectus, “ not cooked
enough.”

234. Meritoria. This word signifies properly “that which is let sor
hire,'’ and here it does not mean ‘⁴ taverns‚'' ξινοδοχιῖα, so much as
“ bed-chambers,” or the tertia tabulata mentioned as hired by the poor,
199. For a contrast is presented between the rich and poor, in that the
former are enabled to obtain sleep (magmis opibus dormitur in urbe),
by having houses so large as to contain sleeping-rooms sar removed from
the noise and bustle of the streets ; while the humble abodes of the latter
have no such convenience. Besides it is Umbricius who is now speak-
ing. a poor man who had dwelt some time at Rome, and who, it is more
than probable, had resided in private Iodyinys, aud not in taverna.
Some think that by meritoria, workshops are ineant. which by their in-
cessant din precliule sleep ; but it is better rendered ‘⁴ hired lodgings,”
like the Greek μισθώματι.

236. Caput. “the origin,’' “ source‚'' “chief cause,'' τὸ nupia-m.—
Arcto, froin arcere: it is more correctly written thus, than arto.

237. Et stantis catwicia. mandi-w, ¹¹ and tho abuso directed against
tho standing teain.''——il!1mdr‹1. μάνδρα, is variously rendered. (1) spo-
lunca. (2) stalmlnm. (3) the cattle themselves, and ‘¹ a team,'’ of horsea
or mules.

238. Druso. This is the reading of nearly nll the editions ; if it be the
true one, the poet :illudes to the lethargic nature of Tiberius Claudiuo
