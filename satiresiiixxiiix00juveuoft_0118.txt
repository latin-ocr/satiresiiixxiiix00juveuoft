72 nores ox JUVENAJ.

quities ;’' in verb.—- Tribunal. For tribunale, scil. suyqeetum. The
tribunal was a stage or raised semicircular or square floor upon which
magistrates sat on their sella curulis when transacting public business.
We know from Livy, that it was used by the Consuls when superintend-
ing the comitia, especially by the Praetor at Rome, and the Propraetor
or Proconsul in a province, when administrating justice or fulfilling
some other public function; also his council sat with him, and other
persons as a mark of honour: the Praetor, moreover, had also a tribunal
in the theatre.

36. Quid, si vidisset, die. “ What [would he have thought and said}
if he had seen the Praetor proudly conspicuous, elevated in his lofty
chario't, in the centre of the dusty Circus, clad in the tunic of [Capito-
line] Jove, and having a loose-fiowing Syrian toga of embroidered
workmanship hanging from his shoulders; a crown, too, of such great
circumference‚ that no single neck is able for it.’'—Proetorem; this
word is here used synonymously with consulem,· for the Consul, in line
41 is the Praetor of 36. Praecor is a more extensive term than the γ
other, denoting “the leader of an army,’' qu. prce-ilor. In this de-
scription of the pomp which was exhibited when the Praetor went to
open the Circensian games, there seem to be mixed up some of the cir-
cumstances of a triumphal procession. If line 37 were omitted—which
Ruperti and others consider to be an interpolation—all the circum-
stances might be referred to a triumph. Schrader removes the diffi-
culty by reading victorem for praetorem. We have hardly any authority
other than the present passage to countenance the opinion that the
Praetor presided over the games in such greatstate. However Juvenal
might use some little inconsistency in order to heighten the poignancy
of his ridicule. [This last opinion is Gifford’s, but it is very unsatisfac-
tory. It is the business of a satirist to set forth real occurrences in the
most striking light, and not surely to state that which is contrary, not
only to particular facts but even to usage].—In tunica Jovis. The em-
broidered tunic worn by generals in their triumph was kept in the tcm-
ple of Jupiter.—Pictoe‚ scil. acta—Sarrana lit. ¹⁴ Tyrian,'’ i. e. pur-
ple ;” Sarra, qux, was the ancient name of Tyre.—Aulaec1.togymlit.
‘¹ tapestry “ osa t09‹1‚'‘ i. e. a large. loose coqu, which, from its cum·
brous folds, resembled curtained drapory: as we would say ¹‘ a blanket
of a coat‚” meaning a ridiculously loose and large one.

41. Quippe; this word introduces the proof that no neck would be
strong enough for the crown, “ for, indeed. &c.'' Itis derived qu, qui ut-
pote, and is equivalent to darn—Et, sibi consul nc placcat, ¹‘ and lest the
consul should be too sels-satisfied.'' or “too vain of himsels.'' The
slave had to exclaim to the triumphator at interi-als.—“ Respice post te,-
hominem esse te mcmcnto‚'’ words evidently horrowed from the history
ns Philip of Macedon. The very presence of a slave taught the con-
queror a lusson on fortune. Placent, i. e. abdqum.

43. Da, “Add.''—Surgn'e, ⁴⁸ is· on the point os springing from,'' scil. with

of this an engle was cari-ed, (the volucris). a chief military ensign.
