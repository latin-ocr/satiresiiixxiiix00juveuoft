xxviii REMARKS on THE STYLES or

Rome, were continuously and speedily breaking down the state ; the tri-
bunic seditions of the Gracchi, Drusus, Apuleius, dic„ and, shortly after
these, the civil wars, proscriptions, perpetual dictatorships, and trium-
virate, gave it a great shock. The public morals [vid. Liv. Pref.] at first
gave way by degrees: but now they began to decline rapidly, riches and
pleasures having created a blind longing for universal destruction. The
Roman citizens, who formerly, as long as srugality and contracted means
won a proper respect, lived an humble and industrious life, were seized,
all along from Sulla’s time, with the most wild and insatiable passion of
gaining and spending, while the very females evinced equal culpability
with the other sex. Cicero, more than once, deplores the falling off, in
public and in private, of that ancient discipline, with which, in the
opinion of eminent judgeS, arose and fell the might of Rome. He also
says that the moderatiori and sels-restraint which the Camilli, Fabricii,
and Curii praetised, were so far from being imitated in his time, that they
were scarcely to be found even in the books then extant ; that even the
writings were no more heard of which set forth the austerity of former
days. The example which Augustus, a most luxurious and lavish prime,
and, above all, which that singular-ly effeminate person Maecenas, set to
the citizens—the amazing wealth which flowed into the city from its
provinces and dependencies—the undisturbed peace which the empire
enjoyed in the reign of Augustus, after being harassed by tumultuous and
long-continued disturbances, were utterly effacing the scanty remnant »
of their ancestors' primitive magnanimity and virtuous morals, and were
fast infusing into all a wish to give way to luxurious habits, to unmanly
inertness, and to sensual delights. These results harmonized with the
wishes of Augustus. He acted according to the advice of his wily
minister, in taking every possible means to divert the minds of his
subjects from the thoughts of their lost sreedom, and from scrutinizing
the change in the posture of the state. that thus his own power might be
firmly established. With this view he allowed the state to preserve its
outae-ard form as before ; the titlcs and dignities of former magistrates
he suffered to remain, while he drew their power to himself; the lower
