SATIRE 111. 61

word is uncertain ; some deduce it from πάροικος, which was a. vessel in
which the instruments of actors were put ; but the meanings are differ-
ent, and sarrae-um has its penult long, while that of the Greek word is
short. As to the orthography of the word in the text, we find it vari-
ously written soracum, saracum, sarracam, and serv-acum. Soractem
is met with in Plautus, but with the penult. short ; therefore they
seem to be different words.—Sarraczcm, a kind of common cart, or
waggon, which was used by the country people of Italy, for conveying
the produce of their fields, trees, aud the like—Its name, as well as
the fact that it was used by several barbarous natium, show that it was
introduced from them into Italy. Capitolinus (Anton. Philosoph. 13.)
states that during a plague at Rome the mortality was so great, that it
was found necessary to carry the dead bodies out of the city upon sar-
raca. Several barbarous nations used these waggons also in war, and
placed them around their camps as a fortification. Juvenal has satiri-
cally used the word to denote the constellation usually called the Plau-
strum, ‘⁴ Charles’ Wain,'’ in Sat. v. 22.

256. Altae, ‘⁴ being raised on high,’' scil. the abies and the pinus.

257. Nam si, (izo. “ For should the waggon have fallen, which carries
large blocks of Ligurian marble, and have tumbled the overthrown mass
upon the moving crowds, what remains of their carcasses.’'—Liynstz’ca
saza, marble, which was obtained in abundance throughout the entire
track of the maritime Alps, and the shore of Liguria, especially at Luna,
a city of Etruria, which lay near Liguria.

258. Axis, put by synecdoche for the entire vehiole.

259. Ossa, from the Greek ὁστέον, ὂιτοῦν, whence ossum, and by con·
traction os.

260. Oba-itum, “ crushed to atoms.’'—Per·it—-more animae, “ vanishes
like the spirit,” perit “is lost [to view].’'

261. Domus, ahc. Juvenal here supposes the slave, who carried the
dole, to be killed by the fallen cart; while his fellow—slaves‚ ignorant
of the catastrophe, and awaiting his return, prepare supper and the
bath for their master, who had gone with the slave for the dole.—D0-
mus, “ the domestich’ Secura, “ unapprehensive.’¹

262. Et bucca, (bc. “ and are fanning with their mouths a little fire,
and are clattering with the well-oiled scrapers.'’

263. Striylibus. The striyz'lis or striglis was an instrument which was
employed, after bathing, to serape off (destm'nyere) the oil and sweat from
the body, Greek §boa-qa, or ζυστρῖς. Some read striyilibzis, a proceleus—
matic ; for the first syllable is short in Persius 5. 126, Hor. Sat. 2. 7. 110.
—Sonat This word is appropriate here, for the striqiles were made of
gold, or silver, or brass, though the more wealthy used in their stead pur-

* ple sponges.—The striyiles were ‘⁴ oiled” to prevent them from hurting

the sinn—Gutta “oil-flask‚” from ριιτια “a drop,’' because having a
narrow neck the oil was dropped yuttacim out of it on the body: quttus
is λήκυθος, μυροθῆκιον.

264. Pueros, i. e. servos—Ille, the servus, [see note on 261] Rup. ;
but it is sar preferable to make the word refer to ‘⁴ the master'' of the
family who was out with the slave, and had, together with the latter,
been killed by the falling waggon. In fact nothing can be more in ao·
cordance with classical usage than such an explanation of ille, Greek
ἐκεῖνος. Ipse, αὐτὸς, was likewise often thus used.

265. Sedet, because he has to wait a hundred years, he seats himself
on the bank of the Styx or Aclzeron.-- Τ atrumque, «hc. ‘⁶ and being a
late arrival he shudders at the grim ferryman, neither is he possessed
