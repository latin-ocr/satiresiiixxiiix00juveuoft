tas, “magistrate,'' or we may render it from the context, “a country
justice.” Ἐξουσὶα is used similarly. In the Italian the ancient name

101. Vasa minora, ‘⁴ salse measures‚’' “ vessels that are too small,''
¹‘ un'ust.”

132. Pannosus—AEdilis, (see 3. 162.) “a ragged (Bur-spem) AEdile.'’
It appears from the present passage that the AEdiles of the borough-
towns and colonies resembled the AEdiles plebis at Rome, who were
the lowest magistrates, and presided over weights and measures.—· Va-
cuis, see Sat. 3. 2.,-the word here must plainly mean, “with few in-
habitants;” the town could not be ¹¹ deserted,'' since it had an AEdile.
Understand incolis after vacuum.—- Ulubrae was a small town of Latium
or Campania, in the Pontine territory nigh the marshes. The penult is
short in Hor. Epist. 1. 11. 30. Est ulubris, ἁο.

103. Eryo, dxc. “ Theresore thou virtually confessest that Sejanus
(like the bulk of mankind—see the 2d line of this Satire) was ignorant
of what he should have wished for.

105. Opes, “wealth and influence.'’ The word originally indicated
¹¹ wealth in flocks.” from ὄΐς, digammated ὅτις, (whence oves), then, by
interchange of a· for r, ὅπὶς, whence opes. By a similar analogy, dapes
comes from δαῖς.

106. Unde altior esset, ἀο. “From which he should have a higher
fall, and a tremendous headlong plunge to accelerate his ruin ;’' φαίητε
is the dative. This whole passage is well illustrated by the following
passage from Hor. Od. 2. 2. 10.

108. Crassos.—Ma1·cus Licinius Crassus and his son Publius feu in
the Parthian war, A.n.c. 701, which the former had engaged in, and
had indeed been the cause of, from motives of ambition and avarice.
He was conquered by Surena, general of Orodes, king of Parthia.—
Pompeios, scil. Pompey the Great and his two sons Cneius and Sex-
tus. Pompey the Great was assassinated, sc. 48, in his 56th or 59th
year. Of the sons, Cneius was slain at the battle of Munda (a city of
Hispania Boetica), on the l7th of March, n.c. 45. Sextus, from his
powerful fleet, styled himself the lord of the sea and son of N eptune; but
Octavius and Lepidus defeated him, and compelled him to fiy to Egypt,
where Antony ordered him to be taken and put to death,13.c. 35.—
Evertit, ἀνίστησι, “ overthrew.''—Et illum, dcc. ¹⁸ and him who reduced
the humbled Romans to his lash.'’—Illum. Julius Caesar, who was
pierced with three and twenty wounds.

109 Domitor, they must have been “humbled” indeed when they
suffered themselves to be flogged. For in the time of the free republic
slaves only were flogged, while a Roman citizen could not be beaten even
with rods (viryis), much less with scourges (flayellis). The use of the
expression, however, is metaphorical, but the satire not the less pun-
gent for that.

110. Summus, dxc. Here is the answer to the preceding question.
Ambitious desires for dignities and rule destroyed tham—Nempe.
This word is only another form for namque—see 3. 95.—Non nullus, is
