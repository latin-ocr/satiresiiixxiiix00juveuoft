SATIRE xm. 101

ιορς these constitute τὰ augasma—stockem Or medio may be ex-
plained as denoting the middle heap of fortune. She is represented by
some authors as having one heap composed of misery alone, another of
joy alone, and the middle one of both commingled.

11. Nimius yemitus, “ immoderate grief.’'—Fl119rantior, “ more
violent.”

12. Vulnere major, greater than his loss warrants.'¹

13. Tu quamvis levium, ec. “ Yon can hardly endure a portion of
calamum, although it be the least of the light, and inconsiderable in
itself‚-—your very heart boiling over with the fire of indignation, because,
ὡς. “οι·, you can scarcely endure the most trivial and paltry particle
of losses, however light‚'’—in this construction quamvis goes with levium,
in the former with minimam.— Viscera is osten rendered ‘⁶ heart’' in the
figurative sense of “ inmost thoughts,'' “ feelings,” &eq some for *malo-
rum, read laborum, “ quod doctius et exquisitius,”—Ruperti.

15. Sacrum, the deposit was “sacred,'' on account of the oath to
which the gods were witnesses.

16. Depositum, §saganam-Siam—Stupet, (ke. “ is he astounded at
such a deed, who is now turned of sixty'{” literally, “ who has now left

sixty years behind him.

· 17. Tm Fasti contain four consuls of the name of Fonteius Capit03
(1) in mu. 720; (2) in Am. 764 or 765; (3) in Am. 811 or 812; (4)
in Δ.σ. 819 or 820. If the second of these be meant, the satire must
have been written in the third or fourth year of Vespasian ; if the third,
it will bring the date of the composition as low down as the second or
third of Hadrian ; if the fourth, it will be still in the same reign. The
more generally received supposition is, that the third is meant; but it
is a point by no means decided, and now hardly capable of determina-
tion.

18. An nihil, ἀρ. “ Have you no better profit from the experience
of so many occurrences,’' ἀρ. of like nature?

19—22. Although, says the poet, Philosophy teaches us to despise
the threats of fortune, yet, by long use and experience (neayistrd υἰίά)
we may attain to the same power. Translate thus ‘⁴ Philosophy, who
giveth her precepts, in sacred compositions, is surely run emm vm-
Qmsmm of capricious fortune; and yet, we deem those favoured t00,
who have learned to bear the ills of life, (not under so great a teacher,
but) by the lesson taught by life itself.—Sczcris libellis, “in her divine
treatises‚‘' sacris is like ἱερὸς and δῖοςς or we may base the interpretation
of sacris on the words of Cicero who says that Philosophy is “ the gift
and invention of the gods,'’ ἁο.

20. Sapientia, nolon Pythagoras first called it φιλοσοφία, the former
name having got into disi-epate, as appearing to savour of too much
arrogance.—Ducimus autem, dte. ‘⁸ But we esteem (ἧγαυμ-ἑθα) those
also happy, who, merely with life for their instructress‚ have learned to
bear the inconveniences of their existence, and not to toss off the yohe‚’'
i. e. bear the evils of life impatiently. A metaphor from restive oxen,
which endeavour to get rid of the yoke by tossing their heads about.
'Phe same idea is contained in the Greek amoim— Vini mayistrti means
that they derived their knowledge from their daily experience.

23. Quae tam, άο. “ what day is so solemn as to fail in disclosing a
thief‚” dxc. Even those days, which in former times were held so
sacred, are desecrated now, says the poet, by every species of crime.
some MSS. read fures which seems more emphatic.

25, Pyxide, “by poison‚'’ Pyxis (νύξις) was properly, “a exaltet?
