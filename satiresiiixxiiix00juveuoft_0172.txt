preyed on by continual pining, οι· rather by vexation, on account of the
solitary and melancholy life which he led. This is supposed to have
given rise to the fable of the vulture preying on his vitals. Banier
further imagines that J upiter‚ having ordered all the surges where the
iron was worked to be shut, lest the Titans should make use of it
against him, Prometheus, who had retired into Scythia, there esta-
blished good forgeS. Perhaps also, not thinking to find fire in that
country, he brought some thither in the hollow of a cane, in which it.
may easily be preserved for several (lays. His having formed and ani-
mated a man, refers to his having taught the barbarous people, among
whom he settled, to lead a more civilised life. Sir Isaac Newton makes
Prometheus a nephew of Sesotris, the Egyptian king, and to have been
left by him on Mount Caucasus with a body of troops, in order to guard
his conquests in that quarter. Some make him the same with Noah,
an opinion which Bryant adopts. Le Clerc supposes him to have been
the same with Magog. The truth, however, appears to be, that Pro-
metheus is in some way connected with the mythology of India, and the
progress of religion from east to west.

36. Sed reliquos, dvc„ “but the footsteps of parents, which ought to
be avoided, and the beaten traek of their oft repeated crimes, long
presented to their view, lead on the rest” of mankind: the children tread
in the footsteps of their parents—Orbita is properly ¹‘ the traek of a
wheel,'’ hence it eomes to signify “the course of life,'’ or, as here, the
trace, ‘¹ i. e. the example'' of one’s life.

38. Hujus enim vel, (hc. “ For there is at least, a motive for this, which
even taken by itself (una) is strong enough (scil. to induce you to eschew
evil), namely that those who have derived their being from us may
not,” ὣς.

40. Dociles, “ apt scholars.'’

42. Quocunque sub axe. ‘⁶ beneath every sky,’' i. e. in every country
under heaven. The meaning of this line and the next is. that one may
see bad men everywhere, but hardly in any quarter will he behold a
man of real virtue.

43. Brutus, the chief conspirator against Caesar, was the son of
Servilia, who was sister to Cato of Utica.

44. Nil dictu, (bc. “ Let no indeecnt word or deod come nigh that
threshold within whose precincts there is a young person.”

45. Procul hinc, (hc. Juvenal, in order to give an air os solemnity
to his important preeepts, adopts the very formulary of speech made
use of at religious ceremonics, to prohibit the approach of the profane:
by this he also intimatos that the threshold‚ within which there was a
child, was to be held sacred. Coinp. Virg. ΑΕΗ. 6. 258. “ Procul, Ο
procul este profani: ίκὰς, inde ἔστι βίβηλοι.

46. Cantas pernoctantis parasiti, ¹· the (obscene) song of the mid-
night parasite.'’

47. Reverentia, “observance.'’—Si qnid, ὼε.. ⁴‘ ifyou are contemplat-

from exhibiting to his view any thing that is wrong. Plutarch says
that. Cato was as guar-dod in his language and behaviour before hin son,
as though he had been in the presence of tho Vestals.
