accustomed to whiten their hides with cha1k3 for only white victims
were sacrificed to the celestial gods—The verb ducere is often ap-
plied to victims, and also, as in 66, to criminals.

67. Spectandus, “ well worthy of our gaze.”—Quae labra ,ἓ quzs illi
vultus erat? “what (horrid) lips he had? what a (diabolical) expres-
sion of countenance Ψ This is said, not from any real hatred of
Sejanus, but through fear of incurring the hostility of the emperor, by
having been an intimate of the former.

69. Crimine, διαβολῇ, “ accusation,’' “ charge.”

70. Delator, συκοφάντης. The Delatores were an infamous class of
men, whose whole lives were spent in connecting charges, chiefly of
loesoe majestatis against the wealthy and noble, a portion of whose pro-
perty, when confiscated, was generally allotted to them—Quibus indi-
ciis, dxc. “ By what information, by whose testimony did [the emperor]
establish [the charge] :⁹⁵ understand crimen. This elliptical brevity well
expresses the eager curiosity of the inquirer. For indiciis, many
MSS. read indicibus, but these would differ from the delatores, only in
having participated in the crime and then betrayed it ; whereas indicia
denote the proofs that the charge was not fictitious.

’ἶ 1. Nil horum. “ There was nothing of this.” No proceedings took
place such as were usual at a capital trial.--Epistola. Tiberius, who was
residing at Caprae, received secret information of Sejanus’ conspiracy;
and wrote a long letter 'to the senate, which contained but slight refer·
enee to the chief conspirator, but treated of other subjects at great
length. This was done, lest a commotion of the populace should be the
result of open invective and menace against Sejanus, and also in order
to gain time for corrupting the Praetorians. Nervius Sertorius Macer,
who was constituted commander of the Praetorian bands immediately
before the death of Sejanus, was the person who bore this “lengthy
communication” to the senate, and he privately made the senators
acquainted with the Emperor’s will. While the letter was being read,
Macer corrupted the Praetorians, and that done, further delay was
useless.

72. Capreae, hodie Capri, an island in the bay of Naples. Tiberius
used to withdraw himself· thither, from the toils of state affairs, and sur-
render himself to the grossest pleasares—Bene habet ; nil plus inter-
roqo. ‘⁴ Tis well—I make not the least inquiry further.'’—Benc habet.
καλῶς ἔχει, is a form of congratulating one’s self or others on some happy
event ; also, of content and approval ; here it is well applied to a per-
son who is eager to gain information; but is deterred by sear of the
Emperor. So also nil plus intem-0570, the sense of which is, the cause
of his condemnation seems to me quite genuine and unexceptionable;
or, I don’t like to pry into the Emperor's deeds and plans. Properly,
the verb interroyare means to ask a question, the answer to which will
be brief, as “ yeS,” or “ no,'' Greek {qm-0231« ; while percontari is to ask
a question which requires a detailed reply, Greek ordenoSoen—-Henni-
nius inserts a comma after bene, and takes habet absolutely in the sense
of periit, “ good,” “ that’s well,” “ he's done for.” Every one knows
that when a gladiator received a mortal wound, the multitude exclaimed
habet, scil. vulnus.— Sed quid Turba Remi? “ But what is Remus’
rabble about ?'’— Turba is used by way of contempt, Comp. Hor. Od.
1. 1. ’1.-“ Turba mobilium Quiritium.” For Turba Remi some Edd.
read Turba tremens, scil. Sejanus’ friends, or the panio-struck populace.
Others read Turba fremens, scil. to ingratiate themselves into the fa-
vour os the Emperor, by not appetu-ing to have favoured the treasonable
