universally believed to be near Mount Atlas in Africa, according to
Apollodorus. This celebrated place or garden abounded with fruits of
the most delicious kind, and was guarded by a dragon (serpens) which
never slept. It was said to be the offspring of Typho, and had a
hundred heads, and as many voices. Many, however, reduce the num-
ber to one head. Hercules slew the dragon and took the apples. Many

· solve this fable by supposing that the Hesperides were certain persons

who had an immense number of flocks, and that the ambiguous word
μῆλον, which signifies “ an apple'’ and “ a sheep,” gave rise to the my-
thic tale. Pliny and Solinus maintaiu that the dragon was no other
than an arm of the sea, wherewith the garden was encompassed and
protected. Dupuis‚ who makes Hercules to have been the sun, and
refers his twelve labours to the passages of that luminary through the
signs of the Zodiac, explains the fable of the Hesperides as follows :—
In the twelfth mouth, making the first coincide with Leo, the sun enters
Cancer. At this period the constellation of Hercules inqeniculus de—
scends towards the western regions called Hesperia, followed by the
polar dragon, the guardian of the apples of the Hesperides. On the
celestial sphere Hercules tramples the dragon under foot, which falls
towards him as it seta—Ponticus. The golden fleece which Phryxus
had hung up on a trec in Colchis was guarded by a dragon, which was
of the same lineage as the serpens Hesperidum. Jason destroyed it,
and gained possession of the fleece,
