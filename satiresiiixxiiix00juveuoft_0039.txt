LUCILIUS, HORACE, PERSIUS, AND JUVENAL. XXXl

death. Hence it is that we find in his poems great freedom of expressing
whatever his indignation prompted. This he could not have done with
safety had he published them during his life-time. Juvenal, like Horace,
was not a follower of any particular sect (Hor. Epist. l. 1, 13 seq. and
Juv. 13. 121) ; and was not inferior to the latter in talent ; he is even
considered his superior in keen and extensive knowledge of the world and
in philosophical lore; but sometimes we detect traces of art which he
had gained by his long attendance at the schools. He was witness, not
only to dismal periods of the state, but also to times during which it
enjoyed comparative tranquillity and happiness under Vespasian‚ Titus,
Nerva, Trajan, and Hadrian; and the Satires which he had written
when a youth, and which he had not dared to publish, were polished by
him in his old age, and given to the world, as he could do so then with
security.

From the brief remarks which we have now made on the times and
characters of Horace, Persius, and Juvenal, we can easily form an
estimate of their relative merits and defects, which we shall now pro-
ceed shortly to review.

These three writers had, doubtless, the same design as all the other
satiric poets ; namely‚ to afford instruction and amusement, and to dis·
play, as in a painting, the morals of mankind. This, however, they
essayed each in a manner different from the other, according to the
diversity of the times in which they lived, and their peculiar talent.
For, in the age of Augustus, when matters wore a lively appearance,
and when the empire and the laws were in vigour‚ a poet might indulge
in a laugh of ridicule at the errors of the day ; but, during the reigns of
Nero and Domitian, when affairs were hurrying to ruin; when vice had
reached its acme, and required violent remedies‚ (vid. Juv. Sat. 1. 45
seq.,· 63 seq.; 73 seq.,· 147 seq. ‚· 2. 25 seq.,· 121 scq.; 162 sequ,- 3.
150 seq.) ; ridicule no longer prevailed ; and the vii-tuous man was filled
with grief, which, being smothered long and deeply, at length rose to in-
dignant wrath. Besides, as we before stated, Horace had been much
softened and polished by intimacy with the most refined persons of the
empire, and was by nature more inclined to merriment than to gravity.
Perhaps he himself had a dread of harsh censorious reproof; and, being
deeply versed in the knowledge of mankind, he was of opinion that more
vices were the offspring of volatility and weakness of mind than of its
bonci fide depravity ; that gentle remedies were more salutary and effl-
cacious than violent ones ; and that it was better to accommodate him—
self to the times, and endure the manners of his contemporaries with
gentleness and moderation, than act the part of a rigorous and 111100111-
promising judge against them. He accordingly does not so much satirize
vices which were as yet ostensibly kept in restraint by the laws, as he does
folly and other errors which do not come under legal cognizance. Nor
does he make it his chief aim to excite a feeling of shame in his fellow-
citizens, or to lay down with grave precision precepts for the proper
discharge of their social duties ; but rather in a skilful, attractive, and
jocular manner, to convince them that they are not such persons as
they wish to appear, and, consequendy, that they cannot impose upon
men of expet-ieme* Hence he even ridicules the foolish and silly as
