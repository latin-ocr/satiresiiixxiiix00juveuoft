278. Hinc, scil. from a lengthened life. Marius was sixty-eight
when he died—Quid, duc. “ what object could nature in all the world,
what object could Rome have produced, more blessed than that citizen
(scil. Marius), if, amid the surrounding band of his captives, and amid
all the gorgeous ari-ay of war, he had breathed forth his triumphal soul
when he was about to descend from the Teutonic car?” i. e. had he died
immediately after his triumph over the Cimbri and Teutones—Opimam,
either ‘⁴ glorious,” or ‘⁶ sated with spoils‚’' alluding to the spolia opima.

283. Pompey was seized with sever in Campania ; and the poet says
that Campania, as though foreseeing the calamities which ultimately
would besai him, had kindly sent this sever to cut him off 3 but that the
united prayers of cities and people rescued him from its grasp.—Pr0-
vida, ‘¹ prescient‚'’ ‘⁴ foreseeing his doom.''

285. Vicerunt, “prevailed,'’ in effecting his recovery.—Ig7itur, (bc.
“Accordingly his own evil fortune, and that of the city, deprived him
when conquered of that head which had been reserved for this,” or
“ which had been thus prese1·ved.'’ Pompey was murdered in his fifty-
eighth year. by Achillas, one of Ptolemy's officers, and by L. Septimius,
a military tribune.

286. Hoc cruciatu, dxc. “ From this torture, from this punishment
were Lentulus and Cethegus free, and fell unmutilated ; Cataline also
lay in death with his body unsevered, or “not dismembered.’‘ Len-
tulus and Cethegus were strangled in prison, see Sall. Bell. Catal.
The ancients believed that their wounds and mutilations followed them
to the next world, and therefore they felt horror at being dismembered.
Pompey, though such an eminent man, was infinitely more unfortunate,
therefore, than these foul conspirators against their country, as he was
decapitated by his murderers. Had he died young, Juvenal contends,
he would have escaped this calamity.

289, seqq. Beauty of person often exposes the possessor to fearful
dangerS‚ therefore it should not be prayed son—F ormam, dte. “ The
anxious mother when she beholds the shrine of venus, prays for beauty
for her sons with murmured supplications of little fervency; but of much
greater for her daughters, even to [the offering of] tenderly-sweet ’
vows,'’ i. e. so as to pour forth vows full of tender sweetness to pro-
pitiate the favour of the fair deity. This is Ruperti’s method‚ the
literal translation being, “even to [the offering os] delights of vows‚''
i. e. “ delightful vows.” The construction is precisely the same as
that of “juya silvarum,” in Virgil, literally, “ heights of woods,” i. e.
⁴⁶ wooded heights.’‘ Another method is “even to delighting in her
vows,'' i. e. “so as to revel in the dainty luxury of her vows.'' An-
other method is, “so as to be the objects of delicious desire‚'’ i. e. that
they may be so beautiful as to inspire youths with passion. There are
other interpretations, but of a nature rather indelicate.

291. “Cur tamenu inquit “ Corripias ?” “ ‘why‚ however, should
you censure [these prayers13' says the mother ;'’ or, rather inquit is for
inquis or inquitis, as the Greek ἔφη and φησὶ are often thus employed,
when a person pretends that something is offered in opposition to what
he has advanced, by one or more either absent or present.

293. Faciem—qualem Ipsa habuit, “ a form such as she possessed,'’
‘¹ Tum romu [Lucretioe] tum spectata castitas incitat [Sex. Tarquin-
iwm]''—Livy 1. 57.

294. Gibbum, “her hump,” from ὖβός, ‘iactemua' Livia the wife
of Rutilius was an old woman upwards of ninety-sevcn years of age;
