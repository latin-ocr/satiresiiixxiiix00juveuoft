SATIRE x. 79

relies to the wretched impostures of astrology‚ which it had formerly
rejected, [he had formerly driven the astrologers out of Italy, and even
put some of them to death] ; and endeavoured to divert the evils of to-
day, by vague and senseless researches into the destinies of to-morrow.'’
—Pila. The word pilus is distinct from pilum. The former has three
meanings3 1. “ A company of the Triarii ;'' 2. “ The first centurion''
of the Triarii was called primus pilus; 3. ‘⁴ The office of this centurion.'’
Pilum is equivalent to the Greek ἴου-σῦς, and means a kind of javelin
used by the Romans, much thicker and stronger than the Greeian lance
lancea, (λόγχη). Its shaft, often made of cornel (Virg. AEn. 9. 698),
was partly square, and five and a half feet long. The head, nine inches
long, was of iron. It was used either to throw, or to thrust with, and gave
the name pilani to the division of the army which adopted it. Pila
seems here to be used in the sense of pilos, or rather of primipilatus,
and therefore it means the post of centurion of the first century of the
first maniple of the Triarii; this centurion was also standard-bearet,
and his post was both lucrative and honourable. The invention of the
Pilum is said by Latin writers to have given name and deity to the
mythic hero Pilumnus.-Cohortes, i. e. tribunatus militum—Cohors or
chors, from the Greek χόρτος, originally signified an enclosure sor sheep
or poultry, and was afterwards used to designate the number of men
which could stand within such an enclosure.

95. Eyreyios equites. Augustus formed a select class of equites, con-
sisting of those equites who possessed the property of a senator, and the
old requirement of free birth up to the grandfather. He permitted this
class to wear the latus clavum and also allowed the tribunes of the
plebs to be chosen from them, as well as the senators, and gave them
the option at the termination of their office to remain in the senate, or
to return to the equestrian order. This class of knights was distin-
guished by the special epithet illustres (sometimes insiynes and splen-
didi) equites Romani. Hence we see that eqreyios here is used for
illustres or insiynes. Some commentators, however, think that eyre-
yios equites, in the passage before us, means the praetorz'un quurd which
was selected for attendance on the Emperor's person; but the following
words rather have that meaning :)-— Castra domestica, ‘⁴ the command of
the praetorian hands-,³¹ or “ household troops,’' or “the town-camp.”
The words in their literal impert refer to the camp which Sejanus had
appointed for the proetorz'an bunds, quite near the city, at the Viminal
gate. The praetorian hands, called praetoriani, scil. milites, and prce-
torioe cohortes, were a body of troops instituted by Augustus to protect
his person and his power, and called by that name in imitation of the
proecoria cohors, or select troop, which attended the person of the praetor
or general of the Roman army. This cohort is said to have been first
formed by Scipio Africanus out of the bravest troops, whom he exempted
from all other duties except guarding his person, and to whom he gave
six-sold pay; but even in the early times of the republic, the Roman
general seems to have been attended by a select troop. In the time of
the civil wars the number of the praetorian eohorts was greatly increased;
but the establishment of them as a separate force was owing to the policy
of Augustus. They originally consisted of nine or ten cohorts, each
consisting of 1000 men, horse and foot. They were chosen at first only
from Italy, chiefly from Etruria and Umbria, or ancient Latium and the
old colonies3 but afterwards from Macedonia, Noricum, and Spain also.
Augustus, in accordance with his general policy of avoiding the appear-
