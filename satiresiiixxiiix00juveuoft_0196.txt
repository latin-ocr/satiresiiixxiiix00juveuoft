words (ἓ) thus :—‘ if this sum does not yet fill your pul-se, but leaves
its mouth yet open and loose.’ This, in the} opinion of these two com·—
mentators, is a figure elegantly taken from articles of attire,³vvhich flow -
the more loosely, and have consequently the more sold-3 or wrinkles,
according as their owners are more wealthy and sumptuous ; while
Brittanicus thinks that it is taken from a hag which has folds 01·=
wrinkles when it is empty. The Old Scholiast‚ however, and most in-
terpreters thus explain the words; ‘if even this sum gather wrinkles
on your brow ;' i. e. ⁵ renders you sad‚’ and consequently dissatisfies
you,' ‘ does not seem large enough in your eyes! The former method
may seem satisfactory, since in that case the metaphor taken from the
dress is continued in 327, and in 138 we have the phrase, pleno quum
ίαν-φεῖ sacculus ore, in reference to the same thing. The latter method
also may seem supported by the words extenditque labellum, by which
chagrin and dissatisfaction are equally weil shadowed forth ; and F ar-
nabius in consequence well explains the passage, ‘ compels you to bend
the brow and hang the lip.’ But Britannicus imagined that this [i. e.
the words extendit labellum, merely] is taken from those who, as though
half·famished‚ eagerly stretch out their lips to receive food. The poet.
might even employ another figure.

We have rarely seen greater obscurity of annotation than exists in
the first part of the above note. We shall endeavour to discover the
drift of Ruperti’s observations, and in order to do so we must critically
examine the words themselves. He says that the opposite to ruyam
trahit is redit in ruyam. Now this last phrase in Persius means lit. .
‘⁴ to return into a sold,‘’ and as a fold or plait in a garment is formed
by doublz'ny the eloth, hence, it came to signisy yenerally “ to be
doubled‚’' “to be multiplied.'’ The word mzdtiplico, lit. signifies “to
render many-rotn‚” and it is evident that both the Latin and English
phraseology comes from the notion of eloth plaited. The opposite οὶ
redire in ruffam, then must be ‘⁶ to be lesseued‚” or “ to be little,'' or
“unenlarged;‘' but can ruyam trahere express this? If so, it must
literally mean, ‘'to contract,” i. e. “to limit,'’ or “draw in a fold,'’
hence “to have a small or contracted sold,'‘ and figuratively, “to be
too limited,'’ “ too small.'’ But what are we then to do with extendit
labellum? Probably xve are to explain it by another figure, and render
it according to Britannicus, ‘⁴ make you thrust foi-ward your mouth for
more‚'’ i. e. “ make you eager for more.'' With regard to the quotation
which Ruperti gives from Koenig and Casaubon‚ we imagine that he is
not altogether correct. The two commentators take the same view of
ruffam trahit as Britannicus, scil. referring it to the solds osa purse.
(i. e. “ still leaves wrinkles in your pursc,'‘ as not filling it), but they
do not agree with him in the explanation of extendit labellum. Ruperti.
however, says that Koenig-and Casaubon dei-ive the expression myam
trahi( from garments, as we stated above; but Ι cau find nothing in
Koenig to that effect. It is the words qfl‘crsius ‘redit in myam'
which form the subject of Kmnig's remark: and it is this error. in our
opinion, which induced Ruperti to take the very forced and imnaturnl
meaning which he does out of ruy 1112 mihin
