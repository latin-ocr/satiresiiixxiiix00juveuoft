A BRIEF ACCOUNT, ETC. XXV

“Alterum illud est et prius Satirae ywanus, (scil. Ennianum, quod anti-
quius est, Rup.) quod non sola carminum varietate (sed etiam orationis.
prosae et numeris adstrictae, Latinae et Graecae, Eup.) mixtum condidit
Μ’. Terentius Varro, vir Romanorum eruditissimus. Plurimos hic
libros et doctissimos composuit, peritissimus linyuae Latinae et omnis
antiquitatis et reram Graecarum nostrarumque, plus tamen scientim
collaturus quam eloquentiae.'’*

The plan which Varro pursued in his Satires (which are also calledlibri)
will be best learned from his own words, quoted by Cic. Acad.‚ Quest. l, 2 :
¹‘ Quae nemo adhuc docuerat, nec erat, unde studiosi scire possent, ea,
quantum potui ( nihil enim magnopere meorum miror) feci, ut essent nota
nostris: a Graecis enim peti non poterant, et post L. AElii nostri occasum
ae a Latinis quidem. Et tamen in illis veteribus nostris, quac, Menippum
mitati, non interpretati, quadam hilaritate conspersimus, multa admista
>x intima philosophia, multa dicta dialectice: quae quo facilius minus
locti intelligerent, jucunditate quadam ad legendum invitati, in lauda-
ionibus, in iis ipsis antiquitatum prooemiis philosophiae, scribere volui-
nus, si modo consequuti sumus.” Varro imitated the style of Menippus.
, Cynic philosopher of Gadara, who used to talk lightly of grave and

erious subjects—-whenee both himself and his Satires have been termed '
³ Menippean” and ‘⁴ Cynical.''

The chief writers of this species of Satire were Julian [the Apostate]
:i his Satire on the Caesars, in which he leans severely on all the Roman
mper01·s‚fr0m Julius Caesar to Constantine, andin his Μισοτώγων, “Beard-
ater ;’' wherein he lashed the inhabitants of Antioch, who used to hold

p to ridicule the length of beard which Julian wore : Lucius Annaeus

zene0a, in his witty effusion on the death of Claudius Caesar, in which
e represents the imperial blockhead to have been translated, not to the
anks of the gods, but to yourds, cucurbitae, κολοκύνθης, for this word was
pplied to persons of stupidity and foolishness; and Claudius perished
y eating a species of the κολοκύνθης, of which he was very fond 3 hence
·eneca entitled his Satire, not ensium, but ἀποκολακῦντωσις : T. Pe-
·onius Arbiter (a man of consular rank, a native of Max-seinos, a favourite
>f Nero, and called “ eleyantiae arbiter ;” he was driven, by the machi-
ations of Tigellinus to commit suicide, which he effen-ted by causing his
eins to be opened) in his satiricum, or libri Satiricffli, in which he
everely attacks the vices of his age-avarice, luxury, pride, dxc. ; Mar-
ianus Mineus Felix Capella, a native of Madaura in Africa (or, ac-
arding to the MS S„ of Carfflage), in his work called Satira or Satiricon,
ivided into nine books, the first two of which form a separate work, an
llegory, the subject of which is the apotheosis of Philologia and her
iarriage with Mercury; Marcianus lived in the fifth century of the
resent era : Anicius Manlius Torquatus Severinus Boethius, a man of

⁴* The only difficulty in the nnderstanding of the above quotation lies in the
'ord pn'us. It is, as we see above, explained by Ruperti as equivalent to anti-
mius, ‘⁸ more ancient ·,“ by Gesner, “more excellent 3³¹ or, abbreviated for posterius,

later.'' Varro was born Δ. υ. c. 638; died, 726 or 7273 was instructed by
v'ae learned L. AElius Stilo, enjoyed the friendship of Cicero, and other distin-
*uished personages3 was made tribune, and filled other offices in the state3 em-
raced Pompey's interests in the civil wars3 but was reconciled to Caesar, and

ie was 84, he had written 490 books; but very few portions of his works are

ὀλυ-κεῠσῶτατος.
