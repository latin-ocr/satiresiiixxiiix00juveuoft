on ROMAN sumn. xxi

indeed, but they differed in subject, and in the style of handling it3 for
they satirized the errors of the philosophers and poets only3 they did
not aim at reforming the manners of every-day life, and we may feel
sure that if we had any of the Silli left us entire, we should see that
their style was very different from that met with in the Roman satires‚
but very few fragments remain, which do not admit of an accurate
comparison. We shall not combat with the assertion that Lucilius in
particular, and his imitators, drew some of their colours, and pungency,
from the old Greek comedy (Vid. Hor. Sat. l. 4. 1—10, 14; and Pers.
1. 123), from the Iambi, the silli, and Satyric fables; but the Greeks
are not on that account to be considered as having written satires, nor
the Romans as having exhibited what they had received from the others.
Moreover, that the origin of satire was Roman, not Grecian, can be
proved from history, and from the very form of the name. At an early
period, when neither Satyri, and the Satyric dramas, nor any species
of Greek poetry was known to the Romans, the Satira succeeded to
the Saturnian and Fescennine verses on the stage as we saw above,
and the term (satire), from some resemblance consisting chiefly in the
variety of argument, was transferred by the authors and grammarians,

great weight, explicitly declare that the latter was the invention of the Romans;
and it seems not at all unlikely that it sprung from the rude jests, and witty raillery,
which the Roman youth used wantonly to utter οι] the stage at remote periods.
Further, not only in the argument and method with which it was handled, but
also in the style itself, we discover great dissimilarity; for, in the first place,
if we look at the argument, which lay in various kinds of ridicule, the Horatian
satire cannot in any way be compared with the comico-satyric fables of the
Greeks, the Lucilian can, in some measure, for it presented some traces of
their sarcastic facetiousness. For the satire which Horace's charming and
polished wit adorned, which Persius' gravity pointed, and J uvenal's unbending
severity armed, as it were with poison, was the result of uncompromising moral
rectitude, and depended upon an enlightened and liberal judgment of human
affairs, and on the becoming indignation of a noble mind; it therefore took its
materials from those more weighty vices which were visible in men's lives and
characters, and which possibly might be checked by the lash of satiric reproof
to the advantage of the community at large. The Greek Satyre, on the other
hand, rather possessed a spirit of censure, than a desire to effect a correction of
abuses; it assailed now the condition, now the personal deformities of indivi-
duals, so that it did not exhibit even decency or a, sense of shame‚ from the dis-
gusting character of its subjects and expressions. Now this species of wit so
called was sar surpassed in worth by the gentlemanly and elegant humour of the
Roman poets before mentioned, which did not lie in quickness‚ or a solitary bon
mot; but in a continuative series of expressions. However, Lucilius' satires
seem to have come rather nearer to the former, as they employ the same subject
for their ridicule, have a similar design, show the same disregard to modesty, and
possess the same degree of boldness. In the second place, with respect to the me-
thod of handling the argument, [i. e. style of writing], the dispute will doubtless be
carried to certain forms of satyric poetry, in which even from their outward aspect,
or from the law and structure of their composition, traces of resemblance may be
discovered. But it is now clear that the satyrio dramas of the Greeks cannot be
compared with the diductio satire of Lucilius and the rest, with sufficient aptness
and distinctness. Yet although the Romans in writing satires were sometimes
remote from the dramatic speeies, which takes a wide range, and imparts to the
style the variety of dialogue, and sudden vehemence, yet these embellishments
of dramatic composition were resorted to by those who applied “the file'‘ for
the polishing of their satires; and a species of Roman comedy became general,—
confined by a closer bond of dramatic action than the Greek fables. Who is
not reminded of the Fabellae Atellanae, which were said by the ancients uni-
versally to be most closely allied to the Greek Satyres? However, we must
limit this opinion of the ancients to a more certain ground; namely that the
comic satyre of the Greeks bears comparison with the satires of the Romana
