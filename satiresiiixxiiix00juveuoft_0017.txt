’ἴϋῦ Μ· 0¹¹·AE1· Μ’ he cannot fulfil his intention of seizing Ireland

833 ζ 80 39 Juvenal who had suuhed dechunafflon up to thss
time, begins to devote himself to the cultivation
of Satire, being stimulated by the success which
had attended some verses which he composed

against Paris ; but on account of Domitian’s
tyranny‚he does notventure to recste any conv
posstion even to a snudl audstory; so says Sue-
tonius :—on which Oudendorp makes the follow-
ing remarks, “ our author prosecuted literar>⁷
studies and declamations for his own amusement
till his fortieth year. IIe then gave utterance to
some satirical effusion against Paris, a pantomim-
ist of Nero, who shortly afterwards put him to
death” (see San 6. 87) 13ut Juvenal did not
then pursue his poefflcalstudics,at least he dhl
not publish any poems until in his eightieth year.
Under the emperor Hadrian (who mounted the
throne A.u.c. 870), he was unable to restrain him-
self from launching forth against the vices of the
populace, but recited his Satires publicly‚ and in
the 7th Sat. l. 87, he inserted the name of Paris
the pantomimist of Domitian, instead of that Paris
who had been Nero& pantonnnnsn Frouithe
tenor of 7. 90, ake„ the histrio, who was Hadrian's
chief favourite, became hostile to our author.
through a suspicion that by Domitian and Paris,
Juvenal intended to represent Hadrian and the lais-
trio himselffiyuratively. But Hadrian, though he
was induced by the other to adopt the same sus-
picion, was not willing to punish the poet, as he
was an encourager of talent z and he accordingly
devised a mode of punishment in this case which
was of a somewhat jocular character. This was

1 no other than to give Juvenal the prefectship ot

ὶ an Egyptian cohort, as though a reward for his

verses,since he had spoken so sathicassy of the
favourite’s infiuence in procuring military com-
mands, or as a pretext for removing him from the
city.

It is perfeetly clear that these incidents did not occur
in the life of Domitian, for his death is intimated

ν in Sat. 4. 34, &00 and Martial speaks of Juvenal

as being alive under Trajan. The histrio, there-
fore, mentioned in Sat. 7. 87, is not the pantomim-

ist of either Nero or Domitian, but of Hadrian.
Consuls, Imp. Tit. Fl. Vespasianus (son of Vespa-
sian, Sth time) and T. Fi. Domitianus (Τὼ time).
