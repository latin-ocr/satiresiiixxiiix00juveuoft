49. The poets had not yet contris-ed the fiction of Jupiter, Neptune,

¹⁸ Not yet had any one (Neptune, scil.) obtained by lot the fatal empire
of the deep (i. e. the empire of the fatal deep), or had grim Pluto with

the ocean whjch cause great havoc.— Torvus Pluton. Ἀΐδης ἀμείλιχος

51. The poets likewise had not yet invented the ridiculous sables re-

52. Beyibus. Pluto, Minos, AEacus, Rhadamanthus, and Triptolemus.
There was no need of these judges, since crimes were not even known.

deficiency of respect towards one‘s elders was a capital offence.

55. Si juvenis, dxc. “ If a youth had not risen up before an old per-
son.” Compare, ‘⁵ thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour
the face of the old man‚” Leviticus xix. 32.

56. Barbato cuicunque, “to any one with a beard,” not only to a

⁴ though he may see at his home more strawberries and larger heaps of
acorns,'' i. e. though the puer were much richer than the barbatus.

61. Si reddat, dxc. “ If he restore the old leathern bag with all its
