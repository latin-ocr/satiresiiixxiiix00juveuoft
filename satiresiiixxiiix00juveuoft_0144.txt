3581). chi spatium, ὠο. “ [a mind] which may rank the last stage of
life among the duties of our nature.'’ It was part of the Stoic doctrine
to have no dread of encountering things which were unavoidable. The
meaning of the present passage is, that we should pray for such a mind
as may be calculated to look on the termination of our earthly career
as a duty, and so may not dread it. It would be unnecessary to say

those who study wisdom and virtue, who have proper control over their
passions, and who do not seek those extrinsic advantages which are
subjected to fortuno‘s power, but who earnestly pursue the attainment.
of those mental excellencies which are real blessings, and of which sor-
tune cannot deprive them ; but those who do not look keenly into the
causes of things, and are carried away by depraved desires, are led by
their ignor-anco tacitly to confess their belief that worldly events occur.
not by divine direction. but by fortunc's will, and to this they ascribe

Numen. Among the poets signified : 1. The will of the deity. and what-
ever was an indication of that will: 2. Ilis power and majesty, (as
perhaps in the present passage); 3. The deity himself, and 4. his nature

thee in the skies.”
