SATIRE xiv. 123

taste for gluttony, from the example of his father, will be irreclaimablo
from the gratification of his propensity.

13. Lauco paratu (i. e. apparatu) “with sumptuous preparation.’'

14. A maynd, duc. “Not to degenerate from (his father’s) ample
kitchen,” means, to maintain the same style of luxury as his father.

15. illicem animum, ὡο. “ Does Rutilus inculcate gentleness of dis-
position, and a style of conduct indulgent to moderate errors; and does
⁷ 118 think that the souis and bodies of slaves are eomposed of the same
materiale as ours and of like elements; or does he virtually give les-
sons in cruelty, who,’' dte. i. e. does that father, who displays inordinate
cruelty to his slaves for the most trivial fault, give such an example to
liis son as would afford him a relish for clemency, and justice, which
regards slight offences with mildness? Understand the enclitic ne,
or an, or num, in line 15-Proecipz‘t, armemini—Elemcntmn is from e
and limem—Rutilus appears to have been a tyrannical master: we know
nothing more of him. Britannicus thought that the individual alluded
to here was a person who lived in J uvenal’s time, and who, after he had
squandered his wealth in luxury, was necessitated to become a gladiator.
Others think the Rutilus of Sat. 11. 2. and the present to be identical.

19. Ρίᾶρανιιιη. Phryne, from τληγὲ, “ blows ;‘' pla'yae, from αλὰξ.
πλάκας, “ elimes,” or ¹⁴ regions‚'' pla'yae, from πλὶιω, “ toils.’'—Et nul-
lam, ἀο. i. e. who deems the sound of the lash to be infinitely more
pleasant than the Siren’s harmonious mains—Sirena. The Sirens
were fabled Sea-nympha who charmed so much with their melodicus
voices, that all forgot their employments to listen with more attention,
and at last died for want of food. They were the daughters of the
Achelous by the Muse calliopa or, according to others, by the muse
Melpomene or Terpsichore. They were three in number, called Liyeia,
Leucosia, and Parthenop& or, according to others, Agylaoplzonos² Molpa,
and Thelxiope, or Thelaeizsne, and usually lived in a small island near
Cape Pelorus in Sicily. Virgil, however, places the S tranum Scopuli
on the coast of Italy, near the island of Caprea (AEn. 5. 684.) They
were informed by an oracle that, as soon as any persons passed by them
without being charmed by their songs, they should perish. Ulysses
having been previously informed by Circe of the power of their voice,
stopped the ears of his companions with wax, and ordered himself to be
tied to the mast of the ship. When he came within hearing, he made
signs for his crew to stop the vessels, but they were disregarded. The
Sirens in despair at their disappointment thrcw themselves into the
sea. The etymology generally assigned to the word is σειρὰ, catha,
because those who listened to them were drawn as if by a chain; or,
more probably from the idea of an ιῖρμος or “ connected song.’' But
Bochart deduces the name from Sir, a Phoenician word denoting “a
songstress,” which savours the explanation given of the fable by Damm.
The latter states that the Sirens were excellent singers, and divesting
the fables respecting them of all their terrific features, supposes that by
the chat-ms of music and song they detained travellers, and made them
altogether forgetful of their native land.

20. Antipha'tes, (bc. ‘⁴ The very Antiphates, and Polyphemus of his
terrified household.’' Antiphates was king of the Laestrygones, who
were cannibals. The commentatore on Homer (Odyss. ι’, 114 seqq.)
generally locate the Laestrygones in Sicily, but we have no authority in
Homer for this: on the contrary he places the Cyclopes and Laestry-
gones far apum—Laris, this word is here used especially with reference
to the domestios of a household. The ancients differ extremely about
