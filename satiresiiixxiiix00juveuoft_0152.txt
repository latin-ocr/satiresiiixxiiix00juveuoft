106 NOTES 011 JUVENAL.

from the Liparaean workshop, wiping his black arms (previously to his
handing the pocula to the gods), after the nectar had now been drained
(out of the Crateras, into the cyathi or small pocula).’' For Juvenal
v alludes to the passage in Il. l. 597, seqq. ‘⁶ He also,” Ruperti pro-
ceeds, “ marks the great difference between the three cup—hearers, two
of whom, Ganymede and Hebe, were most beautiful, and one, Vulcan,
deformed, and blackened with smoke. But this explanation of the
words siccata nectare is very harsh, and the vulgar lection seems to
require some emendation. I used to think that we should read nec
jam, (or rather aut jam, as in 11118 50,) siccato nectare tendens Brachia
Vulcanus, i. e. ‘ and Vulcan acted, not as cup-bearer (scil. ad cyathos
erat), stretching forward his arms (scil. to reach the cups to the gods),
after the nectar had been drained (into the small cups).’' Heinecke
condemns Ruperti’s conjecture, and exhibits in his note a total igno·
rance of Ruperti's meaning. Another conjecture of the latter com-
mentator, if adopted, would remove all difficulty; he proposes libato
nectare, “ aster having previously tasted the nectar;‘’ according to this,
Vulcan was not only cup-bearet· but proeyustator. Dr Stocker has the
following remarks :--It will be best to content ourselves with the most
simple exposition: that ‘ after the nectar had been all drained from the
bowI, Vulcan wiped his arms, black from his Liparaean workshop.’ To
throw the greater ridicule over these celestial compotations, and to
make, at the same time, the widest contrast between Vulcan and the
fair cup-bearet just mentioned, the former is represented as coming hot
from the forge, and not even having the good manners to make himself
decent and tidy, till the banquet and 1115 services were over. He did
then make himself so far comfortable as to rub the sweat and soot off
his bare arms, but not till then.'' Others explain, ‘¹ Vulcan after
drinking nectar in heaven, and after having wiped his arms, had not
yet returned to his Liparaean workshop.’' Others, ¹‘ Vulcan wiping his
arms, was not reclining at the table of the gods and drinking nectar-'⁹
Others, ‘¹ Vulcan was not yet the dcitics' workman, who now 111-1585 after

washing his hands either with water, or wetting his hands with the nec-
tar that was drunk (!)'‘ Others, ‘¹ Vulcan in his Liparaean workshop had
not yet wipcd from his mouth. with his black arm, the nectar 118 had
drunk.” Achaintre's interpretation, which Dr Stocker has adopted, seems
decidedly the best. The ancient scholiast notes3 ctiam ca: siccatosoecu·
