is known of Sostratus whatever, consequently, we cannot be certain in
what way the sentence is to be correctly rendered. Heinecke strongly
contends that madidis alis means “wings sui-charged with moisture,''
which therefore incapacitated Sostratus from soaring into the clouds,

i. e. rising into the sublime in poetry. Thus, the meaning will be, that
Α he was a bad poet. The first interpretation that we have given above
is that of the old Scholiast.

179. Ille is joined in construction with barbarus, scil. rex, i. e. Xerxes.
-Qualis “in what plight,'’ 0†0;.—Salamis, an island in the Saronicus
Sinus (Gulf of Egina), on the southern coast of Attica. It is now called
Colouri, and is celebrated for a battle between the Greeks and Persiaus,
fought, October 20, Rc. 480.

180. In Corum, dm. “ to vent his passion on the northwest and south-
east winds by scourging them.'' Corus, Greek Ἀφέται-ης, Xerxes, when
he heard that his bridge over the Hellespont had been destroyed by a
storm, ordered that three hundred lashes should be inflicted on the above
winds, and that two chains should be thrown into the sea, beasting that
his sway was not only over the winds but also over Neptune (Ennosigae-
us) himself. Herodotus sayS, that he whipped the waves, not the windss

181. Numquam, dm. Even AEolus, their monarch‚ treated the winds
with less rigour than the wisc Xerxes-hence we infer that barbarus
in this line signifies not so much pe›·eyrinzcs as soezvus, inhumanus.
AEolio, see Virg. AEn. 1. 51.

182. Ennosiyaeum. Ἐννοσίγαιος properly Ἐνοσίγαιος, a name of Nep-
tune, from ἒνόθω “to move,” and γαὶα, so also Ἐνοα-ίχθων in Homer and
ὅ mum-323 ‘75⁶5 (Pindar). These epithets seem to have been given to Nep-
tune from the circumstance, that when earthquakes occur the sea is greatly
agitated. Gellius assi gns another explanation, namely, that earthquakes
may have been thought by the ancients to be occasioned by the agita-
tion of waters in the depths of the earth. Perhaps, as Neptune was
the personified symbol of all waters, allusion may be made by this name
to the deluge of Ogyges, which broke down the mountains which hemmed
in the inland sea formerly covering Thessaly, and formed a passage
through the vale of Tempe.

183. Asilius id sanc, ὼε. “ No doubt there was some lenicncy in his
notaccounting it dcserving ofthc brand.’' Ironical.—Stigym‹1t‹1 στίγματα
were letters brandcd on the forcheads of fugitive slaves.

184. Huic, (bc. ‘⁴ Would any ot tho divinitics bc inclined to favour'’
or ‘⁴ assist that man,'' Xerxes, scil. The old Scholiast takes servire in
the sense of ‘⁶ scrvc,'' (θητεύειν Hom.) as Neptune worked for Laome-
don, Apollo for Admetus, ‹bc.; but the other sense is preferable. Mar-
shall reads this clauso without a note os interrogation. which gives the
words an ironical turn : thus, it would mean, ‘¹ Oh, no doubt, any of the
gods would serve him, sor he must bo a kind master as he did not brand
Neptune.”

186. Nempe. dvc. Herc is the answor. ⁴‘ Just. then, in one boat.

terni valcat rme aava morari—Nave. i. e. Piscator-ia scapha. Justin.
This is either hyperbole of the poet. οι· he alludes to those l‘ersians
