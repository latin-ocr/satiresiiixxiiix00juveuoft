Capitol. Notwithstanding his withdrawal aster the first oration had
been pronounced‚ Cicero subsequently arranged and published the series
of orations which he had prepared to speak in case Verres should 11319
defended himself.

54. Tanti, ἁο. “ Let not all the saud of the shady Tagus, 91911
the gold which is rolled by it into the sea, be of such 131119 111 1111119
eyes, as to induce thee to deprive thyself of sleep, and to accept
rewards hich will be ro osed thee, and to thy sorrow be an object of
perpetual apprehension to an influential friend,”-Opaci‚ scil. from the
trees along its banks.—53. Arena aurumque, either a hendiadys
“golden sands,'’ or (as we 11319 translated it) 311 instance of Epexe-
gesis; the difference between which figure aud apposition is, that
the former has the copulative, the latter has not.-56. Ponenda,
much doubt attends the interpretation of this word. We 11319 translated
it in' the> sense of proponenda, (which makes the phrase analogous to
τιθέναι ἄεθλα), and the allusion is to the inducements held out by a
‹maynus amicus to any one, to become a sharer in his crime. Others
render ponenda “which ought to be refused,⁷' and thus there is an
opposition in the word to sumas. Others “ which afterwards you may
be compelled to restore him.’' Achaintre translates it, “which you
must leave,'’ sooner or later. Heinecke paraphrases by, “rewards
which an influential friend gives his confidant, to propose the accom-
plishment of some crime to others,'’ an interpretation which is very
forced. Schrader conjectured horrendaque proemz'a.— Tristis (οὐ χαίρων)
this word may either go with ponenda in the sense of “ which you must
resiqn 1-0 roun somtow,'' or with sumas, or with timearis; for the posi-
tion of the et does not preclude the latter construction.——Tz'mearis
amico ,· when a person became participator in the secrets of a powerful
friend, and consequently an object of dread to the same, lest he might
divulge them, he might truly be called tristis, as he was in constant sear
of assassination, according to the old adage ‘⁴ dead 111911 1911 110 13195.”

58. Acceptissima ‘⁴ held in highest esteem.'’—59. Fatem' “to declare,'’
‘¹ confess.''

60. Neo pudor, (10. “ Nor will the shame [which I must feel in
speaking of such persons] prevent me from so doing.⁷’—Non possum,
ἀο. “Ι cannot, my sellow-citizens, endure a Grecian Rome, and yet
[Ι should not say Grecian, for] how small a proportion of our dregs are
even Grecian [in comparison with that of other countries which we 11319
amongst us, for indeed], long since has the Orontes of Syria flowed
down into the Tiber‚¹’ ‹re—Quirites, Juvenal does not employ the word
here after the fashion of orators in their addresses, but to present a
conti-ast to Groecam.—Rome might well be called Groeca urbs, from
the number of Greeks who had flocked thither, and who had caused the
language, customs, luxury, amusements, and profligacies of their nation
to become prevalent at Rome. All the citizens who maintained a
feeling of 191191311011 for the virtues of early days, complained that the
city was corrupted by the depraved morals of the Greeks3 the effect of
this was, that the very name of Greek, and even the splendid works on
philosophy in that language, were by many looked on with 31915103.-
Syrus in Tiberim Orontes, i. e. the Syrians who dwell nigh the Oron-
tes (a river of Syria), have flocked with all their vices to Rome, situated
on the Tiber. The allusion is particularly to 1119 people of Antioch,
on the Orontes, who were exceedingly depraved; but it may refer gener·

lly to foreign luxury, which was first brought from Asia by Cneius
Manlius. The Syrians and the other Eastern nations were notorious
