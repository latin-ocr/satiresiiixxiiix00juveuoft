LUCILIUS, HORACE, PERSIUS, AND JUVENAL. xxix

sciences, and, if he did not actively stimulate his subjects to the practice
of virtue, yet, by rewards and punishments, he caused them to preserve
a semblance of it. Thus, then, honour and honesty, a feeling of justice
and truth‚ and an' appreciation of the excellent and the elegant, had not
yet become entirely extinct, but were even kept alive by the study of
Greek literature which still prevailed.

At this period (scil. from 689 A. U. c. to 746) lived Horace, a man of
gay and agreeable disposition, courteous, polite, humorous, sprightly‚·
no less a favourite of Venus and Bacchus than of the Muses, faithful
aud sincere, grateful and kind. He was sprung from a father, who,
though he could not claim high birth, was most commendable in his
conduct, and was a faithful guardian of his son’s morals. Horace was
possessed of great natural abilities, which he had chastened by acquain-
tance with the Greek authors ; and, by close intimacy with the most ac-
complished and influential personages of his time, he had acquired a con-
siderable polish. He flourished in security in the favour of Caesar and
of the chief men of the state; not, however, by any means adopting or
servilely assenting to their views and opinions. Trammelled by the laws
of no system of philosophy, he culled flowe'rs at one time in the garden
of Zeno; at another, of Epicurus (vid. Epist. i. l, 1-13). Private virtue
he taught and practised‚ when no longer it was displayed in public:
and, when Brutus and Cassius 'were conquered, and the chief power was
conferred on Augustus, he yielded to fortune, and commenced to write
for his subsistence, wishing to be. enabled to pass his life remote from
politics, and aiming merely at the possession of a moderate coiupetence.

After Augustus the state of affairs was altered greatly for the worse-
Liecntiousness and the other vices, which during his reign had, as we
said before, been either in some degree curbed, or, at least. indulged
rather in private, were after his death freed from all restraint. and the
succeeding emperors even sanctioned them by their examples. The
most abandoned of the Caesars were, lst. Tiberius, a man naturally
cruel and vicious, but who dissembled his real nature during the lives
of Augustus and Germanicus, and managed afterwards to strengthen
his power by depriving the people of their right of elections, and by
cutting off manxpersons even on groundless accusations of treason.
2d1y. Caius Caligula, a monster of depravity, a methodical madman.
3dly. Claudius, a man of dull intellect‚ entirely given up to his wives
and his freedmen. 4thly. Nero, a person not more notorious for his
crimes than his folly. 5thly. Galba, a man of miserly disposition.
ssthly. Otho, effeminate and luxurious. Tthly. Vitellius, cruel, indolem,
and gluttonous. After the death of the latter, the state enjoyed tran·
quillity during the reign of the moderate Vespasian, and his successor
the generous and excellent Titus. Domitian succeeded the last-named
monarch, and again were the morals of Rome destro5ed ; so much so.

as well to individuals as to the state at large, was by the senate and the
people unanimously gifted with the title of ‘⁸ Optimus ;” the latter
strengthened the state by laws, relieved the provinces, and aided the
literati with generous profusion ; he corrected the judiciary proceedings
and greatly improved military discipline. In the periods preceding the
reigns of Vespasiau and Nerva, there existed scarcely a shadow of the
