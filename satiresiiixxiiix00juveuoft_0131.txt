fixed on an elevation. The Romans, like the Macedonians, in early
times never erected any trophies on the field of battle, but carried home
the spoils taken in war, with which they decorated public buildings, and
also private houses of individuals. subsequently, however. the Romans
adopted the Greek practice. The first trophies of this kind were
erected by Domitius Ahenobarbus and Fabius Maximus, 13.c. 121, after
their conquest of the Allobroges, when they built, at the junction of the
Rhone and the Isara, towers of white stone, on which trophies were
placed adorned with the spoils of the enemy. Pompey also raised tro-
phies on the Pyrenees after his victories in Spain. Still, however, it
was more common to erect some memorial of the victory at Rome than
on the field of battle. In the later times of the republic, and under the
empire, the erection of triumphal arches was the most common way of
commemorating a victory, many of which remain to the present day.

134. Et fracta, dxc. ‘⁴ And the cheek-piece hanging from the shat-
tered casque.” The general name for a helmet was yalea, (agaim,
poetice κὸρυς, πήληξ), which was originally made of skin or leather, and
was hence called κυνέη, but the same term afterwards was used to de-
signate those made entirely of bronze, πάνχαλκος. Helmets which had
a metallic basis were called in Latin properly cassides, although the
term yalea and cassis are often confounded. There were two cheek-
pieces, παραγναθὶδες, which were attached to the helmet by hinges, so
as to be lifted up and down. The young reader will observe that buccula
does not mean “the beaver‚’' for the latter was what we better know by
the name of “ visor.'’ cassis is generally derived from χέζω “ to con-
tain ;’' but it seems preferable to take it from κασσίτερος, which was the
plumbum album of the Romans, a metal fusible and white. That it is
akin to the Greek is proved by the form of the accusative, cassida, met
in the Latin writers.

135. Et curtum, dxc. This line and the next have no reference to a
trophy, but to a triumphal arch.—-Curtmn temone juyum, “the war-
chariot deprived of its pole,'’ temo. i. e. ρυμὸς.--ΙΙ. ἐ, 729.

136. Aplustre, “‘ the flag.” This translation (adopted by Stocker)
must not be taken as litet-al, but as among us the loss of a vessel‘s stay
is the indication of her defeat, so it was with the aplustre. The latter
was not a flag, but was an ornament of wood which constituted the
highest part of the poop of a ship. It arose immediately behind the
yubernator‚ who held the rudder and guided the ship, and it served in
some degree to protect him froin the wind and rain. A pole, spear, or
standard (στηλὶς, cruxis) was sometimes crected behind the aplustre, to
which a fillet or pennon (ταινία) was attached. This served both to
distinguish and adorn the vessel, and also to show the direction of the
wind. The synonymous Greek term is ἄφλαστον, which is from ὦ and
φλᾶσθαι for θλὶσθιιι, “ not to be beaten by the waves.”—Summ0 arcu,
“ on the top of the arch.” The arcus triumphalis was an entire struc-
ture, forming a passage-way, and erected in honour of an individual, or
in commemoration of a conquest. Triumphal arches were built across
the principal streets of the city, and. according to the space of their
respective localities‚ consisted of a single arch-way, οι· a central one
for carriages‚ and two smaller ones on each side for foot passcngers‚
which sometimes have side communications with the centre. Those
actually made use of on the occasion of a triumphal entry and proces-
sion, were merely temporary, and hastily erected; and, having seri-cd
their purpose, were taken down again, and sometimes replaced by others
ot* more dui-able materiale. Stertinius is the first upon record who
