Juvenal to which Umbricius replies quibusdam, oze. According to
Achaintre they are the words of Umbricius who asks the question and

editions have no interrogation; the passage then is an inference of
Umbricius, “the reason is because they can no otherwise obtain re-
pose.'’

the feeble.—Cavet‚ “ he steers clear of him, &c.'’

πέμπειν, “ to escort.”-Breve lumen, “ whose glimmering twinkle.’'

287. Cujus, dvc. “the wick of which I part and trim,” a graphio

should burn too fast or go out.

288. Miserae, dic. “Just listen now to the prelude of one of these
unhappy quarrels, if that can be called a quarrel where you strike, and
I only am beaten ;'' that is, where the fight is all on one side ε for rixa

words or blows.— Vapulo, ·‘ I must bear the blows,'’—this is one of that

leek ; the sectile and the capitatum. The former was the coarser.

φέρβηξ, from quiqam—Commii, ‘⁴ clubbcd with you.”

296. Ede, “tell me.'' Consi-stas, “ station yourself,’' scil. to beg‚—
in qud, dxc. ‘⁶ In what beggar’s stalF’ or ‘⁴ In what Jewish oratory am Ι
to seek you.'’ The προσευχαὶ were Jewish houses of prayer, built gen—
