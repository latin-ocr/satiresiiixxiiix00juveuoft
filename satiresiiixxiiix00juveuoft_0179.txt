SATIRE xiv. 133

126. Servorum, «ko. ‘⁶ He pinches,’' lit. “keeps in bounds his ser-
vants’ appetites by giving them short, measure.‘' Roman slaves received
monthly, or daily, an allowance of corn, called demensum (from deme-
tior.) Donatus (on Ter. Phorm. 1. 1. 9.) says that every slave received
four modii of corn a month; but Seneca speaks of five modii as the
allowance.-The modius was the principal dry measure among the
Romans3 it was equal to one—third of the amphora, and therefore con-
tained l gallon, 7 pints and a traction English. It was also one-sixth
of the medimnus.

127. Ipse quoque esuriens, ‘⁴ while he is even half-starving himself.''
His own meanness subjects him to the torments of Tantalus, starving
in the midst of plenty, ‘⁶ maynas inter opes inops,'’ Hor. Od. 3. 16. 28.
-Νεριιο enim, «tc. “ for not even does he ever bring himself to make
use of his musty fragments of mouldy bread, accustomed as he has been
to keep, in the middle of September, a hash that was dressed ‚vester-
day, and to defer to the time of a second meal the summer bean that
he has sealed up along with a piece of a mackerel, or with the half of a
shad, (and that too, a stinking one), and to lock up the numbered fibres
of a shredded leek.”—Hesternu.m νιιίηιῖίαῖ, θοίνη ἵωλος. The Greeks, by
the phrase ‘⁴ yesterday's food,'’ meant ‘⁶ stale and rancid food ;” and the
epithet ἕωλος was thence transferred to anything which had become
(morally) ‘⁶ stale” or ·'‘ obsolete.”-— Septembri. During this month the
heat was most violent, and of course meat would soon be tainted.—-The
conchis and lacertus were most common and cheap articles of food:
comp. Sat. 3. 293.--AEstivam, as it, was summer, the beans would be
more tough than in the spring—Luceni. The lacertus was a common
sort of salted fish, according to the Old Scholiast. Ruperti considers
it to be the maekerel: others a pilchard.-Siyncztam. He even puts
his seal upon the cup-board to prevent his servants from pilfering or
picking it. The ancient housewife used to keep her stores under seal,
and not under lock and key as nom* The miser does not eren trust
his wife, but acts as his own housekeeper.—Putri simo-o, so Sopater
and Diod. (in Athenaeus) have ean-33» σίλουρονι this word is derived
from esim and οὖρά by Athenaeus, but Bochart contends that it is formed
from φίλος and figas—Fila numerata. There are fibres resembling
“threads” which hang downwards from the bottom of a leek. These
the miser is so stingy as to shut up, after having first counted them.—
Porri, see Sat. 3. 293.

134. Ad hoec, “ to such fare as this.’'—Aliquis de ponte, “ any beg-
gar.’‘ Bridges were the usual haunts of mendicants.—Neqal›it, will
refuse to attend.'’

135. Sed quo, ὣς. “ But for what purpose do you possess the wealth
that you have amassed with such mental tor-ture ἐ“’ Understand habes
or possides.

⁴¹* Although Ruperti produces authorities in support of this statement. it ap-
so absurd that we may well be pardoned for doubting it. If the mistress
of a house did not look up her stores, it was not because she had not the keys of
the apartments3 for the keys of them all, with the exception of those of the wine-
ceum, were given to a Roman woman when she first entered her husband’s house
aster marriage. Hence, when a wife was divorced, the keys were taken from
her (Cicero Philipp. 2, 28)2 and when she separated from her husband she sent
them back. Indeed keys were used in very early times, and were probably in-
troduced into Greece from Egypt. Pliny, however, records the name of Theo-
dorus of Samos as the inventor, the person to whom the art of fusing bronze is
ascribed by Pausanias.
