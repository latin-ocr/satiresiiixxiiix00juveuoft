SATIRE III 33

upon the public way, should be 70 feet. Trajan reduced this to 60 ; and
Nero required that there should be a passage between each habitation.
8. Soevoe on account of the pericula—9. Poetas. The silly poets of
Rome in Juvenal’s time were wont to bore, by their own spoutings‚
those unfortunate persons who remained in the city during the hottest
month ; ⁴ this Juvenal humorously classes among the calamities that
attend a residence at Rome.

10. Tota domus. “ While his entire family and effects are being
stowed,'’ dxc. Reda, this was a four-wheeled vehicle which the Romans
used in their journeys: it is a Celtic word [Gallie according to Quin-
tilian], and connected with the German 'reiten and our ride. The
cisium (cabriolet) had but two wheels. The carruca was a carriage for
ladies, and is also from the Celtic.—Una shows the scantiness of Um-
bricius' filrniture.

11. Substitit “ He stopped for it,'’ scil. the waggon, and while he
waits, Juvenal and he hold the following colloquyz—-Arcus, arches,
this cannot be the monument of the Horatii, for that was not an arch
but a pillar, ’γωνιαία ceux& ; Ruperti, on account of the epithet veteres,
would refer the word to the “ triumphal arches” of Romulus, (which
were originally built of hrioli, but afterwards of marble)‚ were there
aut proof that the latter were near the gate Capena 3 as this, however
,s deficient of proof, he refers it to the arches of the aqueducts.—-
Capena, now called “St Sebastian’s gate,'' led out into the Appian
way, towards Capua; it is called here madidam “dripping,'’ on ac-
:ount of the aqueduct which was over it, (“ quia supra eam aquaeductus
ast, quem nunc appellant Arcum stillantem’' vet. schol.) or from the
mmber of springs in that quarter‚—if this view be adopted, madidam
nust be rendered ‘⁴ surrounded by fountains,'’ [like ‘ aquosa Ida’ in
Horu] : from the latter circumstance it received the name of F onlinalis ;
md from the triumphs passing through it, was called also Triumphalis.

12—17. The common editions have a semicolon after Capenam, and
ι full stop at amicae‚ whereby hic will be considered as alluding to
Capena, transl. ‘⁶ the spot where Numa used to make assignations with
ils mistress by night ;” but this plainly is wrong, for the “grove'’ where
<uma met Egeria was at a considerable distance from the qam, being in
he vale of Aricia. We have adopted the punctuation of Ruperti, ac-
:ording to which the sentence must be constructed thus :—“ Here,
δεικτικός), where Numa used to appoint an hour for assignation with his
nistress by night ; namely, into the vale of Egeria we [scil. Umbricius
md Juvenal] descend, and into grottos, un 'ke the natural ; at the pre-
ent day the grove with its consecrated sp ng, and its shrines are let
o the Jews, whose furniture consists of a basket and hay (for every trec
las been commanded to pay rent, and the forest [i. e. the Jews, its
mcupauts] goes a beggffig, since the Muses have been served with an
jectment).'' If the style here seem too abrupt, Ruperti proposes to
ead hinc for hic, which will mean “leaving this—scil. the gate—we
.escend,'’ dxc. F or information respecting Numa and Egeria consult
Aivy, Ι. 19 and 21.-By his using the word amicae the poet gives us to
mderstand that Egeria was neither Nymph nor Muse, but a harlot.
l'he yrove had been sacred to Diana, which Numa consecrated to the
Jamnoeff-Fontis, this fountain flowed through the middle of the wood
