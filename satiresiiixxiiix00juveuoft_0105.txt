SATIRE 111. 59

Drusus Caesar: however many commentators not perceiving the humour
of connecting Drusus with “ seals‚” have conjectured somnos urso, from
the well-known> somnolency of the Ursine tribe. Thus then the mean-
ing of the sentence is ; the noise of curricles and drivers is so great as
to waken the drowsiest animals. Graevius proposes Druso vetulisque
mritis, as old men are prone to sleep. Jacobs reads vitzclisvn 3 but this
destroys the humorous effect of the odd combination.

239. Si vocat, dvc. “ Should business summon the man of wealth, the
crowd will give way as he will be carried along [in his litter], and he will
run over their heads on the shoulders of his stalwart Liburnian slave.'’—-
Super ora. As the crowd make way they will look up at the great man,
and therefore he will be carried “ over their faces.”-Liburno. Liburnia
was a province of Illyricum, along the Adriatic. Zara, anciently J adera,
and afterwards Diodora, was once its capital. The Liburnians were an
Illyrian tribe, and their country now answers to part of Croatia. They
are supposed to have sent forth a part of their number to Italy, and de-
scended as far as Iapygia, dividing into three tribes, the Iapyges, Pen-
cetii, and Calabri. Some make them the most ancient inhabitants of
Italy. Liburnian slaves were much employed at Rome as chairmen,
dte. from their strong build of frame.

241. Atque obiter, Not only does the rich man arrive at his destina-
tion much sooner than the poor pedestrian, but he can even enjoy himself
as he pleases, and lose no time—Obiter, ·‘ on the way ;” or, as the Greeks
say ἓν παρόδῳ, παρέργως, ἓν παρέργῳ, i. e. as our phrase is, ‘⁶ by the
way'n

242. Namque facit, (bc. “ For the sedan with its closed lattice pro-
vokes sleep.’' Lecticoe were sedans or litters, in which the person carried
was in a recumbent posture; they were carried by slaves called lecti-
carii, and were used in the earliest times only for travelling in ; for inva-
lids (Livy); and also for carrying out the dead (Nepos). In later times
they were used in the city by way of luxury or convenience, and had
curtains to protect them from the dust and sunshine, and that the per-
sons carried in them might not be seen by passers by. They were fre-
quently constructed so as to hold more persons than one.—Fenestra.
This word (from φαίνω) signifies properly any opening in the wall where—
by light and air may be admitted to a building; hence “a window.''
The ancients used a kind of transparent stone (lapis specularis) instead
of our glass. Glass windows (vitreae) were not brought into use until
the fourth century.

243. Ante, scil. nos.- Tamen, ‘⁴ Notwithstanding” that he reads or
sleeps on the way.——Properantibus, “ though we make all the haste we
can.’'

244. Unda prior, ‘¹ the surging mass of people in front,'⁷ κῦμα χερ-
σαῖοι, This denotes the crowd of retainers who escort their patron, and
go ‘⁸ before” his lectica ‚· to which is opposed the populus qui sequitur,
i. e. “who are in the wake [of the sedan].’'-—A9mine‚ “ moving crowd.''

245. Assere, ‘⁴ sedan-pole,'' the pole by which the litter was sup-
poi-ted.

246. At hio tiquam capiti incutit, “ while one knocks a beam against
my head, another a kilderkin.’¹ Some read liquam for tionum—Me-
treta. This was a vessel which held ten consyae'i, and is the same as
cadus, which is the name of a vessel, not of a measure.

247. Pinquia‚ “incrusted‚” “all bespattered.’' Lz‘ltum is “mii-e,”
linum, “an herb which yields a yellow d)·e.’'—Plant‹i mox undique,
⁴· anon 1 am trampled upon on all sides by the foot of a grenadier, and
