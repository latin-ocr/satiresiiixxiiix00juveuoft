48 NOTES ox JUVENAL.

denoting “powerful,’' “strong ;” and hence the frequent titles of 2⁵0>
μίγαλω, δύναται, given them by the Greeks. In this case we may com-
pare with the Caluri, the Dii Potentes in the augurial books of the Ro-
mans. Sehelling derives the word from the Heb. Chaberim by which the
name Gabii-i is made to signify “ the associate deities‚'’ and he compares
those deities with the Dii Consentes, or Complices, whose worship the
Romans borrowed from the Etrurians. Pictet thinks that he has found
in the mythology of the ancient Irish, the worship, and the very names
of the Cabiri of Samothrace. Muller and Welcker reject the Oriental
origin of the Cabiri. Miiller sees in them a worship purely Pelasgic,
and up to a certain point, the primitive religion of the Greeks entire,
with a distant relation at the same time to the Theogonies of India;
Welcker discovers a mixture of various elements, successively amalga-
mated, and the most ancient of which would be the Dardan or Trojan
Penates becoming in process of time the Dioscuri, or else consounded
with them, and at an early period transported to Rome. As regards
the names of the individual Cabiri, it may be remarked they all appear »
decidedly Oriental. Axieros is said to have signified in the Egyptian ·
‘⁴ The all powerful one,'' and he is supposed by some to be identical
with Phtha or Vulcan; Axiokersus, “the great fecundator,'' thought
to have been the same with Mars, the planet named in Egyptian
Ertosi, a word which presents the sanie idea; Axiokersa is couse-
quently ‘¹ the great fecundati-ix,” AphrodItc orVenus, the companion of
Mars. The name of the 4th person Casmilus is said to impert “the
all-wise‚’' by those who trace it to the Egyptian. Boehart, however,
with more probability, compares it with the vHebr. Cosmiel, which sig-
nifies “a servant,’' “a minister of the deity.’' Savzotkracum.—The
most celebrated mysteries of the Cabiri were those held in the island
of Samothrace. They were solemnized every year, and lasted for nine
days. Persons on their admission seem to have undergone a sort of
examination respecting the life they had hitherto led, and were then
purified of all their crimes, even if they had committed murder.

147. Quid? quod. “ What [shall we say of the fact] that.’‘—Jocus is

signifies ‘⁴ active recreation,” consisting of bodily exereise. Lusus de·
