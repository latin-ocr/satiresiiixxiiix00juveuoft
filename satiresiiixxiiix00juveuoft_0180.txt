134 NOTES ON JUVENAL.

ness to live [as] under the condition of poverty, in order that you should
‹lie wealthy.'' Many MSS. have eyentis andmany have eyenti. The
text of Ruperti (Glasgow, 1825) has the former, but Stocker reads
eqenti, which he must have taken from a later edition of the German
commentator. The latter is undoubtedly the more elegant lection.

130—140. Your anxious pursuit of wealth brings you no satisfizcfion:
fur the more you amass. the more powerful and restless becomes your
wish for mone—Pleno ore, “its top overflowing,” i. e. “ being filled to
overfiowmgf’

140. Ec minus, the. “And less wish for it (pecuniam) has he who
‹loes not possess it.'’—Eryo, i. e. in consequence of your desires for
wealth being insatiable.—Paratur. The act for the endeavour; “you
arc on the look out for a second villa.’'

141. Rus, ‘⁸ country—seat.'’

142. Et proferre libet fines, “and the whim seizes you to extend the
limits of your property.’'

143. Mercari-s, (ke. (see note on 140, paratur). ‘¹ You try to pur-
chase both this (scil. corn-field), and the vineyards, and the hill, which
is white with the thickly-planted olive.’' Arbustum is “ a place planted
with trees,’' especially to train vines3 hence, ‘¹ a vineyard ;'' it is differ-
ent from vinea, in which the vines were supported by poles—Canai,
the leaves of the olive have a whitish shade.

145. Quorum, seqq. If the owner of these places cannot be iuduced
to seli them to you, you will then resort to nefarious contrivances to
iot-ce him to part with them.

146. Illaeri boves lassoque famelica collo Jumenta, “ your lean kine
and famished oxen with jaded necks‚” dxc. The three epithets are very
‹expressive3 lasso collo, shows that the cattle have worked hard all day,
consequently they arc the more hungry. ,

148. Nee prins (retrahentur) inde domum quam, «hc. “ Nor will they
he taken home from that again until the whole crop descends into their
rnvenous stomachs.'’—Novale (νιὸς) was properly a field which was

which would be greater in amount than those of fields not novalia.—
Soevos. Comp. iratus venter, IIor. Sat. 2. 8. 5. It may also be ren-
dered ‘⁸ enormous‚'’ ⁴¹ prodigious.”

it was reaped by thc sickle.’'

151. Venales fecerit. ¹¹ has brought to tho hammor.''—Injuri‹1.
⁸· aggression,'’ scil. such as has just been mentioned. From the present
passage we may justly inser that no system of superintendance over
rural districts was adopted by the civil power; although some kind of
police force existed in the city under the praetors and aediles.

152. Sed qui, «ke. ⁴¹ But,'’ says the poet, ⁴· although you are possessed
of wealth and power‚'' yet if you procure them by such villanous conduct.
what do you think will people say of you? can you imagine that they
will talk of your behaviour respectsully?'’ The miser answers in 11110
153 and in the two lines that follow—Sed qui, «ke. “But how does
the talk go? How sounds the truinpet of scandalous report3”

153. Tunicam lupini. ⁸· the husk of a lupine ;'' i. e. ⁸· the most worth-
1053 object.'’ The miser replies that 110 would not give a sarthing sor the
pruises os all ιιι-11111111 him, if his sarm was small and yielded a poor crop.

154. Tuo· vicinia papo, ¹⁴ the surrounding people of the entire dis-
