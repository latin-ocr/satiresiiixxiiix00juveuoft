iv ΗΒΕ or JUVENAL.

representation, Juvenal was banished from Rome, under the pretence
of an appointment to a military command in Upper Egypt, his exile
would be of no long duration ; as the favourite was, almost immediately
after, disgraced and put to death. That our author was in Egypt is
certain (see Sat. 15. 45); but he might have gone thither from motives
of personal safety; for, in 94, an. Domitian banished the philosophers
from Rome, and soon after from Italy, with many circumstances of
cruelty. Juvenal, being eminent for learning and virtue, might then
have deemed it prudent to withdraw from the city; he could not, how-
ever, have at any time been long absent from Rome, where there is
strong internal evidence to show that all his Satires were written.
Whether his Egyptian voyage was matter of necessity or prudence, we
find henceforth in our author the most intense hatred of tyranny; and
his indignation is chiefly directed against the emperor himself, whose
hypocrisy‚ cruelty, and licentiousness, now became the object of his
keenest reprobation. He did not, indeed, recite any more in public:
but he continued to write during thc remainder of Domitian’s reign, to
which period we may assign several of his Satires (scil. 3. 5 ; and per-
haps 13 and 11.) In 96, ΔΑ). Domitian luckily died, and Nerva his '
successor recalled the exiles. From this time, therefore, there can be
little doubt of Juvenal‘s residing at horne and pursuing his studies with-
out further molestation. The alth Satire would seem to be his first
after Domitian's death. Juvenal died aged upwards of fourscore.
