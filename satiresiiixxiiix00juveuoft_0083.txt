SATIRE 111. 37

now exhibited public shows of gladiators, and at the in-turning of the
’ rabble's thumb, cause the death of any one [gladiaton scih] they wish,
in order to gain their favour.’'—-Cornicines‚ Gr. κεραύλου, the horn
was used to call the people together, as at the shows in our country
faits—Municipium was a town out of Rome, particularly in Italy, hav-
ing its own laws and magistracy, and also the right of Roman citizen-
ship ; i. e. each inhabits the privileges of a Roman citizen,’ ex. yr. osvoting
in the comicia at Rome, (but this right was not enjoyed by all municipia),
and offerin g themselves as candidates for all public offices there. The word
is derived from munia “duties of an office‚'’ and capia—35. Perpetui, this
word is from per and peto, and properly means, ⁴⁶ penetrating.” Its sy-
nonyms are AEternus, αἰώνιος, which means “having neither beginning nor
end,’' ‘¹ eternal,'‘ also figuratively, in the sense of immortalis, ἀθάνατος, z'. e.
“having a beginning but no end,’' “ immortal,⁷' “undying ;’' perennis, διε-
τῆς, is properly, “that which lasts throughout the year‚” then, “that lasts
many years,'’ and, as sempiternus, ἀείδιας, “that lasts sor ever:” per-
petuus denotes properly a relative duration to a certain point of time,
and is used improperly in the sense of sempiternus, that certain point
being regarded κατ’ ἐξοχήν, as the end of all time—Comites, as having
hired themselves to gladiators even in the provincial towns,—Bueca may
either allude to their cheeks being puffed out in playing tho horn, and
is therefore humorously employed by ,Juvenal instead of facies; or as
signifying “persons who make much use of their mouth‚‘' it may be here
taken to mean ‘⁶ low provincial advocates‚’⁷ or ·‘ pleade1·s‚'' or perhaps

“criers.” These mean wretches, says Umbricius, by their evil prac- -

tices, have amassed such wealth as to enable them to exhibit shows of
gladiators at their own expense—36. Munera were at first given by the
magistrates, afterwards by the emperors, and finally hy all persons who
enjoyed civil offices, even though they were exeeedingly low and worth-
less, for the purpose of gaining popularity, and so of securing their own
advancement to dignities. Various decrees of the senate were passed
to check this conduct—The phrase ‘munera edere is peculial-ly applied
to gladiatorial shows, as ludos facere to scenio yames. The persons who
exhibited these shows were called BIuneratores, minian-arii or editores.
—Verso pollice, the people, if they wished the death of a gladiator,
pollicem vertebant, or convertebant ,· if they wished to save him, pollicem
premebant, when the thumb was versus it was called ioffcstzcs, which
means “ directed against’' anything, for they turned llic tlzumb in, to-
wards tlte breast, to indicate that the latter was to be piereed by the
swerd ; they did not, as some think, turn it upward, which vertere would
scarcely express nor did they hide it beneath their dress, as Heinsius
supposes, nor press it down, keeping the rest of the fingers extended,
which is the opinion of Plathnerus. Our word “ poltroon’' is derived
from pollice trunci ,· sor many who wished to avoid serving in the army
used to cut their thumbs off, to incapacitate themselves from so doing.
—37. Occidunt, “ suffer to be slain,'’ or, “ give the signal for the
death.'’—37. Populariter either ‘⁴ for the purpose of gaining popu-
larity,'' or, “with the applause and favour of the people,” or, “to
amuse the people.''

37. Inde reversi, dxc. the common explanation of these words is that,
having returned home from the shows, after having been drained of
money by the expensive exhibitions they had given, they contract no
longer for the respectable means of livelihood, but for the low and mean,
ex. gr. the soricoe ,· but Achaintre’s interpretation is more correct, “ so
base, grovelling and covetous are those men, that aster returniny from
