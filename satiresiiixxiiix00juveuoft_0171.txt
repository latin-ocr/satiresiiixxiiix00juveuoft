sums xiv. 125

a Graecism, like Homer's δᾶκε pogium. φέρειν, ἄγειν οι· ’ἔτασσε magum
the Latin construction would be serendas—Eisdem, the same as her
mother employed—Cinaedz‘s, this word (κίναιδος) 15 supposed to come
from κενὸς and εἶδός, 1. 0. “ void of shame.’'

32. Vitiorum exempla domestica, “examples of vice when in our
homes.''—ma9nis Quum subeunt animos auctoribus, ‘⁴ since, in conse-
quence of their high sanction they insinuate themselves into our minds.’'
We have instances in the best writers, of quum being joined to the indica-
tive as well as the conjunctive, when it denotes a cause or consequence.
(ex. gr. Ter. And. 3, 2, 8, and 3, 5, 17, also Heaut. 2, 4, 2.)
The commentators render it “ when’' in the present passage; but this
would involve a tautology. For, if we examine the context, we shall
at once perceive that domestica exempla can only refer to the examples
of parents. According to this, then, the meaning would be, “the ex-
amples of our parents corrupt us, (irc. when they steal into our minds in
consequence of the high sanction (of our parents).’' Any one will see
that it is much better to consider the latter clause as explanatory of the
former; as it is in consequence of the parent's authority being weighty
that the parent's example takes possession of the mind, and that thus
we are sooner corrupted by their example than by that of another.

34. Hoec, scil. vitia parentum—quibus arte beniynd, ὡς. “whose
hearts the Titan formed by a benign exertion of his skill, and of bet-
ter clay than usual,'’ i. e. there may be one or two young persons who
have a propensity to virtue, and an instinctive dislike to vice: but
these are exceptions; they must have been formed of other materials
than the rest of mankind—Finxit, ἒφλᾶσι.- Titan. The T itane-s were,
in Greek mythology, said to be the sons of Coelus and Terra; sorty-
five in number, according to the Egyptians; Apollodorus mentions
thirteen, Hyginus six, Hesiod twenty, among whom are the T itau—
ides. They were all of gigantic stature, with proportionable strength.
Their wars against the gods are very celebrated in mythology; these
are often confounded with the wars of the Giants; but the war of
the Titans was against Saturn (who was himself a Titan, and suc-
ceeded his father), and that of the Giants against Jupiter. Perron
makes the Celtoe to be the same with the Titans, and their princes the
same with the Giants in Scripture. According to him, the Titans were
the descendants of Gomer, son of Japhet. He adds that the word
Titan is perfect Celtic, and derives it from tit, “ earth,'' and den, or
ten, ‘¹ man‚'’ and hence, he says, the reason of the Greek appellation,
γηγενεῖς, “earth—born,’' applied to them. The Titans, according to
Bryant, were those Cuthites, sons of Chus, called giants, who built
the tower of Babel, and were afterwards dispersed. The Titan to
whom Juvenal alludes in the passage before us, is Prometheus, son of
«Iapetus (a Titan), by Clymene, one of the Oceanides. The fable of
his pilfering fire from heaven is well known. According to Apollodorus,
he made the first man and woman on the earth, with clay, which he
animated by means of the stolen firc. By Jupiter's orders he was tied
to 3 rock of Mount Caucasus, where for 30,000 years a vulture was to
seed on his liver, which was never diminished‚ though continually de-
vom-ed. Banier supposes the fable of Prometheus to be merely a con-
tinuation of the history of the Titans. Prometheus, as he conjectures,
was not exempt from the persecutions which harassed the other Titans.
As he returned into Scythia, which he durst not quit so long as Jupiter
lived. that god is said to have bound him to Caucasus, being much ad-
dicted to astrology, he frequently retired to mount Caucasus, as a kind
of observator-y, where he contemplated the stars, and was, as it were,
