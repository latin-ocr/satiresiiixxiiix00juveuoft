sumn XIV. 127

60—58. Nam si, (bc. How can you presume to reprove and punish
your son for resembling you, and sinning after your example?

50. Censoris ird, ¹¹ the Censor’s displeasure,'¹ i. e. his animadversion
and punishment. The Censor could punish by affixing a mark of igno-
mIny (called censoria nota) after a person's name in the list of citizens.

51. Quandoque. ‘⁵ Some time or other‚'’ for aliquando.

52. Morum, dxc. “ But, as the son of your morals, too (he will shew
himself like you). and one who can more deeply (than yourself) engage
in crime, following all your footstcps,’‘ i. e. closely imitating your ex-
ample—Morum filius. i. e. by his resemblance to you in morals like-
wise, he win evince himself your son.

53. Omnia, might, we think, better be connected with peccet.

54. Corripies, &a ‘⁴ You will, no doubt, reprove and censure him
in loud and angry language.'’

55. Tabulas mutare, “ to change your will‚” scil. for the purpose of
disinheriting him.

56. Unde, understand sumes. “ Whence can you assume to yourself
a father's solemn frown and freedom of rebuke, when you,’' dte.

57. Vacuumque, tho„ ‘¹ and when the air—charged cupping-glass this
long time is looking for your brainless skull,'’ i. e. when you have been
out of your right mind for a long period—Hoc. i. e. tuum, the more
proper construction would be Caput cucurbitam quaerit, i. e. opus habet,
desiderat—Ventoso, ‘¹ full of air‚'' ‘¹ that acts by the pressure of the
air.” This epithet alludes to the nature of the operation of cupping‚
which is performed by rarifying the air which is within the cucurbita,
by the application of fire, on which the blood was forced from the scari-
fied skin into the cupping-glass, by the pressure of the outward air; so
that the air may be called the chief agent in this operation. The cus-
tom of cupping the head in phrensies is very ancient ; we have trans-
lated Ventosa according to Ruperti’s explanation. Stocker renders it
“ exhausted.⁷’—Cucurbita‚ σικύα, was properly “ a gourd,’' and probably
the cupping-glass received its name from some resemblance in shape.
“ Or a species of gourd (κολοκύνθης) may be meant, which affects a cure
by withdrawing the moisture which impedes the action of the brain.’'
Achaintre.

59—69. Yon take pains to exhibit your house neat and elegant;
why do you not show it free from moral impurity, that your son may
not be familiarised to vice?

60. Verre, ke. Here follow the words of the master urging his slaves,
or, as some think, of Juvenal to the master himself.—-Pav1mentum, “ the
pavement.'’ The floor (solum) of a room was seldom boarded, but was
generally covered with stone or marble, or mosaics. The common
floors were paved with pieces of bricks‚ tiles, stones, dxc„ forming a
kind of composition called ruderatio. Another kind of pavement was
that called opus Siyninum, which was a kind of plaster made of tiles
beaten to powder and tempered with mortar. It derived its name from
Siynia, a town of Italy, celebrated for its tiles. Sometimes pieces of
marble were imbedded in a composition ground, which appear to have
formed the floors called by Pliny barbarica or subteyulanea, and which,
probably gave the idea of mosaics. As these floors were beaten down
(pavita) with rammers (Ῑῐειιῐειε), the word pavimentum became the
general name for a floor.—Nitidas, “clean and bright.”—Columnas.
The Romans were very fond of adorning their buildings with pfllars,
particularly their rooms of state and entertainment.
