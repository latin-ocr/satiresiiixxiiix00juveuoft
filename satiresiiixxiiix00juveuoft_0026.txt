xviii ox ROMAN SATIRE.

than Ennius and the older poets. Lastly, his satire differed from the
Ennian in matter and in form; that is, in its subject, and in his style
of handling the same. For (unlike Ennius) on every occasion he cen-
sured the morals of his countrymen severely, and lashed, not their
crimes only, but the individuals themselves by name with the greatest
freedom, and without paying any regard to loftiness of station; and as
he had formed his mind by the study of the old Greek comedy, he not
only rivalled its almost prosaic style of language, but also its delicate
and keen irony. This is the “libertas verborum,” which Cicero and
others assigned him. Diomedes, with reference to the subject before
us, says, “the modern Roman satire is an abusive composition directed
against the vices of individuals, and possessing the character of the old
Greek eomedy. Lucilius, Horace, and Persius wrote compositions of
this kind. But the original satire, such as Pacuvius and Ennius wrote,
consisted in a vsmmr of subjects, whence also its appellation, satire, is
derived.'' Quintilian says, “ the satire is entirely of our own invention:
Lucilius was the first that won especial distinction thereby.'’ Evanthius
tells us that upon the passing of the law alluded to above, (page 14‚) ·
“another kind of fable, namely satire arose,’‘ (i. e. says Ruperti, the
Fescennine verses were succeeded on the stage by the old dramatic
satire ;) this satire (called also Exodia) contained harsh and rude jests.
and treated of the vices of the age, without however giving the real name
of individuals. After this had degenerated in the hands of the poetS.
Lucilius began to write it after a novel fashion ; sor of it he eomposed
a poesis, (a kind of poem which was only to be read, not acted ; didac-
tic, not dramatic,) that is, several books of one kind of composition.
“ The satire thus invented by Lucilius, and cultivated in their respec-
tive styles by Horace, Persius, and Juvenal, may be defined as a speeies
of composition which aims at portraying the existing manners of men in
lively colours and figures. and not only recommends virtue by moral
precepts—the gravity which is generally seasoned by a gracefullight-
ness and gaiety of expression—but also by the soree of striking exam-
' ples: and at one time by humorous, at another by cutting raillery:

poetry, particularly ; and so has forits objeets the instruction, amusement.

We now come to a point which has long been the subject os warin
critical disputation. namely, whether the name satire. and the composi-
tion itself, or either of the two, was indigenous to Rome. or. like every-
thing else they possessed which had reference to the arts and seiences.
