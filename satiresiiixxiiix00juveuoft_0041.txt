of genuine truth, calculated to seize the mind firmly, and to affect it
with pleasurable feelings. Horace* philosophy, moreover, is that of
life, which teaches us to look with contempt upon power, wealth‚ out-
ward show, and the common pursuits of men; to over-estimate nothing
[nil admirari]; to view mental tranquillity, safe mcdiocrity, and the
power of living for himself in unrestricted leisure, as the greatest bless-
ings a man can receive; to be content even in straitened circumstances;
to make a joyful use of the present; to avoid disquietude respecting the
future; to seek true happiness within ourselves, not from things ex-
ternal; to solicit gifts of fortune only from the deity; but from our-
selves to derive wisdom and equanimity.

Horace gives to some of his satires an epistolary, to some a dramatic
form, in order to affect his readers more pleasurably and forcibly.
Persius and Juvenal also adopted the same plan ; but to pass over the
fact that the latter two reduced only one or two speeches, and but a
portion of their subject ; never the entire—to a dramatic shape. The
dialogue of Persius is more like a poetic figure than resembling that of
Horace, namely, a vivid representation of facts, calculated to afford the
greatest pleasure from the extensive variety of his speeches, from their
elegauce and novelty, and from his ingenious choice of character, and
remarkable propriety of thinking and speaking. Juvenal oftener prefers
to take upon himself the character of teacher or declaimer, than to in-
troduce a colloquy between 'others; but for this defect he compensates
by his vividness of representation, by the justice and dignified gravity of
his sentiments, and by the propriety of his diction. All the three poets—
but Juvenal and Persius more frequently than Horace—introduce per-
sons under their real names contending in argument. This is far from
being unpleasing, as the image is more atti-active and effectual, when
thus it is animated by characters ; yet the reader is often at a loss to
know whether certain expressions are uttered by the opponent, or by the
poet in irony. In his epistles Horace particularly excels in refined wit
[urbanitas]‚ in excellence of subject, and in the consummate skill with
which he treats of the same matters, over and over again, in various
ways ; charming οι· instructing by his digressive remarks‚-—b1endin g the
utile with the dulce, expressing his own feeling with reserve or freedom,
commending or reproving, exhorting or dissuading, those to whom he
writes. He has likewise inscribed his satires, and epistleS, for the most
part, to well-known and illustrious characters ; Persius and Juvenal
generally to obscure individuals. The former plan has most effect in
giving credit and infiuence to the writer’s sentiments ; the latter is to be
attributed to the difference of the times in which the poets lived. Further,
many personS, known only by their names, and by some folly or vice of
which they had been guilty, are frequently dismissed with a word or two
of remark by Horace and Persius; but by Juvenal they are spoken of at
greater length. Sometimes by the latter method the force of the satire
is weakened; but by the former much obscurity is thrown upon passages,
for the accurate understanding of which it would be necessary to be
well acquainted with the persons and events alluded to. However, this
obscurity is common to all the ancient satiric poets. as they wrote sor
their own country; men to whom many things must have been familiar,
which are obscure to us. [Such is Koenig’ s opinion alsoJ. Between
the satir-es and epistles of Horace several points of difference exist, l.
in the form ; 2. ιιι the subject ; 3. the style of language ; 4. the metre.
Eichstaedt thus speaks on this subject, “ With respect to form, inasmuch
as the epistle is addressed to some particular individual, either real or
