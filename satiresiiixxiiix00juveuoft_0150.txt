104 NOTES oN JUVENAL.

a circular plate or boss of metal‚ so called from its resemblance in form
to a bubble floating upon water. Bright studs of this description were
used to adorn the swerd-belt (aurea bullis oinyula, AEn. 9. 359). An·-
other use of them was in doors, the parts of which were fastened to-
gether by brass-headed, or even by gold-headed nails. We most fre-
quently read, however, of bullae as ornaments suspended from the necks
of children, and worn especially by the sons of the noble and wealthy.
Such a youth is called hoeres bullatus (Sat. 14. 4.) The bulla was
worn by children of both sexes as a token of paternal affection and
a sign of high birth. Instead of the bulla of gold, boys of inferior rank,
including the children of freedmen, wore only a piece of leather. On
arriving at adolescence the bulla was laid aside, together with the prae-
tea-ta, and it was often consecrated, on this occasion, to the Lares, or
to some divinity. Many consider that the bulla was formed of a pecu-
liar shape, in order to atti-act the gaze of the passenger, and avert
urentes oculos. In the middle ages the word denoted a consecrated lump
of gold, impressed generally with a scal: hence bulla' is used for a pope' s

ing of the clause is, Don' t you know how tempting another man’s money
is to the eovetous?

35. Vulyo moveat, “ would excite among the multitude.’' From 35
to 119 Juvenal shows that the corruption of morals and the unrestrained
indulgence in vices under which the empire was suffering, took their
rise chiefly from a contempt for religion, which was induced by the
superstitious and foolish theology that had emanated from the hrain of
poets, and was even now by the uninformed rabble (υιιῖρό) held up to
ridicule. As long as religion was simple, men lived purely and right-
eously ; but as soon as the imagination of poets deformed it by the ad-
mixture of subtleties, fables, erroneous opinions of nature, of lise, of
morals, and by polytheism‚ men sunk down from the virtuous habits of
their ancestors to impiety and crime. The poet, therefore, severely
ridiculos the inventions of the poets touching religion.

36. Quum exiqis, ὼε. “ When you require from any one that he
should not commit pei-jury. and should consider. that in any temples
and crimsoned altar, there is some power or deity.''—Even the com-
menalty laughed at any one who thought that the gods would punish the
perjurer.—Rubenti, ‘⁴ red'’ either with fire, or with the blood of victims.

33. Quondam hoc indiqenae, «ke. A pleasant description of the golden
age, in which the religion os the Ausones, and therefore the Aborigines
and Latins was very simple, comprehcnding no deities save Saturn,
Janus, Picus and Faunus, until the Greek mythology was imper-ted.—
