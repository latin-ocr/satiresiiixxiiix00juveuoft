¹ which had been on various occasions carried from Asia to Rome. Some

MSS. read Phaecasionorum in allusion, to buskins (φαικάσια) with which
the Athenian statues were generally adorned. The φαικάσιον was chiefly
used by the rustic population of Attica, and perhaps there may be an
allusion to the more ancient and unrefined emblems of their religion.

219. F ονῦἰαε (dimin. offorus) in the singular would mean “ a shelf'
of books ; the plural “ a range of shelves‚’' “ a book-case.’'—Mediam-
que Minervam. These words have been assigned two different mean·
ings; (1) ‘⁸ a statue of Minerva much mutilated,'’ from the effect of
time, as dimidius, Sat.. 8. 4. (2) “ Minerva down to the waist,” i. e. ‘¹ a
bust of Minerva.’' F igures of this kind were properly termed imagines,
and sometimes thoraces; by the Greeks προταμαὶ ; while statues of full
length were called stacuae iconicoe, or similam-es, ἀγάλματι εἰκονικὰ, οι·
ἰσομέτςηη. The latter interpretation is to be preferred.

220. Modiam, a. definite used for an indefinite quantity.—Meliora,
dxc. “ More valuable and more abundant effects [than those he lost]
does our Persian gentleman replace [in his new establishment], being
the most opulent of those without children, and deservedly held in sus-
picion as having set fire to his own house.'’——22l. Perhaps Asturius
was called Persicus from his oriental origin, and hence also the Asiatio
presents which were lavished upon him, 218.-Orborum lautissimus.
Here are two reasons for his receiving so many gifts : he was childless¹
and very wamy—Suspectus. As persons in our own day have been
known to burn their own houses for the purpose of receiving the amount
for which it may have been insured‚ so this Asturius may have destroyed
his, kuowing that he would be a yainer by the donations which eager
legacy-hunters would shower upon him.

223. Avelli, mid. voice, “tear yourself away from.¹’-Circensibus‚
scil. ludis. Comp. 10. 79. The games held in the Circus consisted prin-
cipally of chariot-races.

224. Sora, Fabrateria, and Frusino, were cities of Latium, now
called Sora, F alvaterra, and Frusilone.-—P‹zratur, “is purchased.”

225. Quanti, (irc. “ For the same price as you now rent a dark hoie
of a house [in the city] for one year.’' Some editions read paretur in
the preceding line.

226. Hic, i. e. In these rustic ‹vities-Nec reste movendus, “and which
does not require to be worked by a rope.” For a deep well a bucket
and rope were necessary. Brevis, not “ shau0w‚’' but “just below the
surface.”

227. In tenues plantae, dte. “ Is profusely poured over the tender
plantS, being of easy draught,” i. e. as the water is drawn up without
trouble.

228. Vive bidentis amans. “ [There] spend your life, devoted to hus-
bandry, lit. to the rake,'’ i. e. to agricultural pursuits. The bidens was
not a “pitch-fork,” but an instrument with two prongs for breaking
eluda—Bidens is an adjective, the word raster being understood. Some
translate bidentis “ sheep'’ in the present passage, but it is equivalent
to δίκελλαι.

229. Unde, “ out of which,'’ scil. garden.—Pytlu1q0reis. The fol·
lowers of Pythagoras, from their belief in the metempsychosis, abstained
from animal food, and lived on vegetable diet. Nor were they allowed the
use of the latter without limitation ; there being some vegetables which
they were forbidden to eat3 for instance they were told ‘¹ κυάμων ,ἀπι-
χεσθαιι,” “to abstain from beans,’' for which precept various reasons
hare been assigned, but perhaps it was rather dietetic than physical or
