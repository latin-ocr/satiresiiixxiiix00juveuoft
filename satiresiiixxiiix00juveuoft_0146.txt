100 NOTES on JUVENAL.

whereas, malo—exemplo denotes that he is the first to do such an act,
and by his example he affords a precedent to others.

2. Prima, dic. “ This is the first'’ or “chief punishment, namely,
that no guilty person is acquitted at the tribunal of his own conscience,'’
’ literaliy, “ when he himself is judge.”—Nocen3 differs from noxius, in-
asmuch as the latter implies habitual guilt, and the former guilt in some
particular action. An analogous distinction likewise exists between
innoxius and innocens.

3. Improba quamvis, dic. “ even though the dishonest partiality of the
Praetor may have prevailed by means of the deceitful urn,” i. e. though
the Praetor may have gained his point, that the criminal should escape
on his trial, by means of the false votes of the judices whom the Praetor
had chosen by lot. The Praetor or Quaes1t0r‚ on whom had devolved a
capital trial, used to choose hy lot, judges selected out of the decurias,
by tablets which were thrown into an urn; so that he was enabled to
benefit the accused by selecting either his own friends, or those of the
accused. The same officer also gave the judges, when chosen, three
tablets, one of acquittal‚ having upon it the letter A. (sor absolvo), one
of condemnation, C. (condemno), and one of ampliation, or putting off
the trial till another day, in consequence of the proof not being clear.
This last had the letters N. L. for non liquet “it is not clear,” or ‘¹ not
proven.” Each of the judges threw one of these tablets into the urn.
and of course, if corrupted by the Praet0r‚ could throw in such as would
aequit the most infamous criminals ; so that the words fallaci urna may
be intended to convey the idea of the judices selecti being corrupted, as
well as the Praetor himself having shown partiality, in the selection of
them. Other editions, however, read fallacis agreeing with Proetoris.
Indeed, it is the injustice of the Praetor that Juvenal here alludes to
particularly, for even though the judices (who were usually about
fifty in number) were not corrupted, yet as each of them privately put
his tablet into the urn, and as it was the Praetor who pronounced sen-
tence according to the majority, it is evident that he could change many
of the tablets, and could adopt other underhand means of procuring
whatever vet-dict he wished to have. The tenor of the passage leads to
the supposition that Calvinus had brought his treacherous friend before
the Praetor, whose improba qratia defeated the ends of justice.

5. Quid sentire, dac. ¹⁸ what do you suppose are the sentiments of all,
Calvinus, in reference to this late villanous proceeding, even the crime
of breach of trust?'' IIere is some little consolation; every one sym-
pathizes with you, Calvinus, and is on your side. For quid emisere
putas omnes, Schurzfl, reads putas homines, and for recenti, Rutgers
proposes retenti, i. c. deposili abnepoti ιιι· non redditi. Martial men-
tions an indifferent poet os the name os Calvinus, but it is probable, that
he was not the person here alluded to.

neither has so slender an income fallen to your lot. that the weight of a
tristing loss should sink you, nor arc such calamitics as you now suffer

it is not tho highest calamity.— Tritus is a metaphor from a well-worn
path. In acervo the metaphor is perhaps taken from a heap of spoils,
