sumn xiv, 141

237. Omni crimine, “ by every species of crime.’'

239. Quantus, &oq “ as strong as was the patriotism that dwelt in
the breasts of the Decii,’' ἁο. There were three great Roman patriots
of this name (1); Decius M'tcs, a consul, who devoted himself to the
Manes for the safety of his country, 111 a battle against the Latius, 338,
B.C. (2) Decius, his son, who devoted himself 111 like manner in his
fourth consulship, when fighting against the Gauls and Samnites, 2⁸³6,
B.c. (3) His grandson, who did the same 111 the war against Pyrrhus
and the Tarenfines, 280, Β. C.

240. Menoeceus, son of Creon king of Thebes, and last of the race
of Cadmus, sacrificed himself to Mars, to save his country from the
Argive besiegers.

241. In quarum, (ke. This line and the two which follow are put in
by Juvenal by way of a sneer at the absurd fictions of the Greeks, and
also to account for his using the expression Si Graecz'a vera in the
preceding line (Comp. Sat. 10, 174). Thus the connexion is,—if the
Greek writers be true in the story of Menoeceus, notwithstanding their
numerous fables respecting Thebes and its origin. Ruperti, however,
remarks that as these three lines tend 111 110 degree to illustrate the
subject under present consideration, but arise merely from a comparison,
their introduction by the poet is out of place, and evinces an unseason-
able wish to display his learning. We doubt very much the correctness
of this observation. Certainly an acquaintance with the mythological
account of the origin of Thebes would be esteemed 111 J uvenal’s day no
great proof of a poet's profundity of erudition, especially when a Roman
author before him (Ox-id) gave his countrymen a detail of the event al-
luded to in these lines (See Ov. Met. 3, 1—130). We think that the
connection which has been shown above is perfectly satisfactory in
determining the propriety of an allusion to the fanciful origin of the
Cadmean city.—In quorum sulcis, ‘⁶ in whose furrows :” quorum
agrees 111 gender with Thebanos implied in Thebas, see 231.—Dentibus
anquis, “ from the teeth of the dragon.” It is said that Cadmus, the
founder of Thebes, sowed the plain with a dragon’s teeth; that from
the furrows sprang an armed race, who forthwith engaged 111 mortal
combat, and they slew each other with the exception of five ; and that
these assisted him in building the city. The five survivors and their
progeny were called γηγενεῖς and Eraga-ol, “ earth-sown.”

242. Capessunc continuo, “ instantly engage in.'’ Continuo, ἄφαρ.

243. Tamquam, (tc. ‘⁴ As though a trumpeter too had sprung up
into being along with them‚¹' to incite them to combat.

244. Eryo iynem, (hc. “ Therefore you will see that fire, the elements
of which you yourself supplied, spreading widely its flames, and causing
universal desolation.'’ The meaning is, that insatiable cupidity, the
first principles of which you implanted in your son, will yet be produc-
tive of desolation to all around him ; as he will stop at nothing to ob-
tain wealth. The metaphor is taken from a conflagration. Cicero
applies the epithet ardens to avarice.

246. Nec tibi. Even you his parent and instructor, he will not hesi-
tate to turn upon.— T rapidumque magn'slrum, dte„ ‘⁶ even with hideous
roar will the lion destroy in his cage the affrighted keeper, though he
had been reared by him.” The particle of comparison is omitted here,
as it is elsewhere very frequently. These lines allude to a real incident
which occurred under Domitian.

248. Nota, dte. Your son will have your nativity cast: and, if he
find you are likely to stand long 111 his way, he will contrive to break
