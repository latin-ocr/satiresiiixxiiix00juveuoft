in court, could be dragged thither with a chain or halter fastened round
their melis—Hi sermones, dcc. ‘⁴ Such were the conversations then
respectiug Sejanus; such were the secret whispers of the rabble.''—-

90. Vis ow, dac. Who, then, would make choice of all Sejanus’ splen-
dour and influenee‚ on the condition that he should undergo such suf-

have haberi, i. e. ‘'‚to be esteemed so highly,” ‘¹ to be in such honour.’'

91. Illi, alteri, “to one.¹’—-Summas curules, ξ’ the highest curule
offices,” understand sellas. The sella curulis was properly ‘⁶ the-chair
of state ;'' the word curulis is derived by the ancient writers ‘from
currus; but it more probably contains the same root as curia, which
is also found in Quirites, Curantes, κύριος. κοίρανος, dvc. The sella curu-
lis is said to have been used at Rome from a very remote period as an
emblem of kingly power, having been derived, along with various other

insignia of royalty‚ from Etruria (Livy, l. 8 ;) according to one account ·

by Tullus Hostilius; according to another by the elder Tarquinius:
while Silius names Vetulonii as the city from which it was immediately

Augustus); and perhaps to the praefectus urbi. Ivappearsfrom the

Cassius. By the ltiylacst curule offices we are to understand that of
Consul. Almost all of the Parisian MSS. read sellas donare curtdes ,-
a lection which evidently proceeded from a gloss.

92. Tutor, “regent ;” but there is also a hit at Tiberius conveyed
by this word3 which also signifies “guardiam” The allusion, there-
fore, in the latter case is to the Emperor's childishness and subserviency
to the wishes and orders of his favouritc.

93. Angyzcstci, dxc. ‘⁴ Now indolently reposing in the confined limits of
Capreoe's stecp.” Some MSS. have αηρυετά, which would mean that
Capreae was now the seat of empire, transferred thither froin Rome by
