SATIRE xm. 105

siders that there should not be full stops in lines 41, 45, 49 and 50 ; and
the sentence from prandebat (46) to pondere (49), inclusive, should be
enclosed in a parenthesiS, in order that the following words should de-
pend on tunc quum, (40).—-Tun0 quum, ἀο. i. e. before Jupiter had
married Juno. The latter was Saturn's eldest child.

41. Privatus, Brittanicus conjectures primaevus; compare Claudian,
“ Talis ab Idaeis primaevus Jupiter antris Possessi stetit arce poli.'’
Burmann thought privatus corrupt, because when Jupiter was but a
little boy in the Idaean caves he could scarcely be called so. He pro-
posed to read, et vayiret adhuc. Burmann the younger, conjectured nutri-
tus or lactatus. But Heinecke says that the word is not to be pressed
too closely, for the poet only means that Jupiter was not invested with
sovcreign authority.——Idoeis antris, his mother Rhea concealed Jupiter
in a cave of Mount Ida in Crete, that Saturn might not devour him,
as he was bound to do, by his compact with Titan his brother. There
was another Ida in Phrygia.

42. Nulla snper nubes, (hc. i. e. there were uo such idle stories as we
hear now, of the magnificent repasts of the divinities.

43. Puer, Ganymede, son of Tros, and brother to Ilus and Assaracus,
He was carried up to heaven by an engle (Jove's minister, Hor.) to be
cup-bearer (οἷναχόος) to the gods. The true narrative is as follows :—
Tros, king of Troy, having made several conquests over the neighbouring
nations, sent his son Ganymede, accompanied by some of his friends,
into Lydia, to offer sacrifices in a temple consecrated to Jupiter. Tan-
talus, not know-ing the king cf Troy’s intention, took these persons for
spies, and having seized the young Ganymede, imprisoned him. He is
said to have died in prison of grief at the insult offered him. Another
account makes Tantalus to have kept him at his court to officiate as
cup-bearer; aud as Tantalus was reputed the son of Jupiter, he may
have taken the sumame of Jupiter himself. The eagle may denote
the untimely death of the young prince, and the swiftness, with which
the short course of his life had passed away. Herodian, however, says
that Ganymede was slain by his brother in some remote place, who
afterwards decreed divine honours to him, giving out, that Jupiter had
carried him away—R. P. Knight has the following remarks in a work
of his. ‘¹ The fable of Ganymede, the cup-bearet· of Jupiter, seems to
have arisen from some symbolical composition, at first misunderstood,
and afterwards misrepresented, in poetical fiction; for the lines in the
Iliad, alluding to it, are spurious; and according to Pindar, the most
orthodox perhaps of all the poets, Ganymede was not the son of Lao-
medon [which many assertJ. but a mighty genius or deity, who regulated
or caused the overflowings of the Nile by the motion of his feet. His
being therefore the cup-bearer of Jupiter, means no more than that he
was the distributor of the waters between heaven and earth. and con-
sequently a distinct persouification of that attribute of the supreme
God, which is otherwise signified by the epithet, Pluvius. Hence he is
only another modification of the same personification, as Attis, Adonis.
and Bacchus, who are all occasionally represented as holding the cup
or patera; which is also given, with the cornucopioe, to their subordi-
nate emanatfflns, the local genii. of which many small figures in brass
are extant.”—Herculis uxor, scil. Hebe, the goddess of youth, and
Juno's daughter.

44. Et jam, «hc. Ruperti states, that not one of the commentators
undet-stands this most difficult passage: of which, he gives the following
interpretation :—“ When neither the Trojan youth acted as cup-bearet·
