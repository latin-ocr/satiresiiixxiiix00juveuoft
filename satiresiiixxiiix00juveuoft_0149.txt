SATIRE xm. 103

would prefer to see the text amended rather than adopt this inter-
pretation. 2. Others explain, “ an age is passing which so far exceeds
the four ages (of gold, silver, brass‚ and iron), that it may be considered
as the ninth, if it be compared with that of iron, and if the corruption
of the morals of men be considered. 3. Others, ‘⁶ our age is twice as
bad as that of iron,'’ which method is nearly similar to the second. 4.
Very many suppose that the Latin poets represented the ages of the world
to be four, and the Greek poets eiylzt, corresponding to the metals as
mentioned above. Ascensius imagined that the first age was that of
the gods reigning in unspotted holiness; the second, that of the gods
defiled with adultery and other vices ; the third, that of the demi-gods,
who were almost divium-the fourth, that of the demi-gods inclining
more to the life of human beings ; the fifth, that of Heroes, who
were mortal, but entirely virtuous; the sixth, of Heroes deformed by
immoralities3 the seventh, that of men, who inclined more to virtue
than vice; the eighth, that of men more given to vice than virtue3 the
ninth, that of men altogether made up of crimes and vices. Grangaeus
suspected that Juvenal assigned to the world as many ages, or muta-
tions of ages, (divided into periods of seven years) as Solon assigned to
a man's fise, of which the ninth was said to be weak and languid. In
the prediction of the Sybil, according to Vossius, the ninth age (and in-
deed the eighth) was ἀνεπίγραφας, i. e. sine tilulo. marked by the name of
no metal, but was described to be the worst of all, as, on the other hand,
the tenth was to be the best, in as much as the ἀποκατάψτασις was then
to take place, in consequence of our Saviour’s advent. [It is almost
unnecessary to remark, that many of the most acconiplished scholars
and divines maintain that several of the Sybil's prophecies had direct
reference to Christ] With regard to the various readings of the pre-
sent passage, some have conjectured Nunc oetacs cyz'lzcr,⁴ others Nonne?
Heinecke would prefer ozon, which he shows to have been often employed
for nonne.- he therefore would place a note of interrogation after metallo.
One MS. has non alias aqitzcr, “in no other way do they live,'' scil. at
Rome, “this is the state of morals there ;⁷’ but Ruperti states that the
ancient writers did not employ alias in this sense ; and, moreover, Rome
is not the subject of the author's present remarks.

31. Nos hominum, dic. ‘³ We exclaim ‘ Heaven and earth !‘ '’ literally,
“we invoke the protection of men and gods.'’ The connexion is, “when
we live in such an abandoned age that we witness daily the most infamous
crimes perpetrated, it is strange that anything which could be done to
us would surprise us so as to make use of ejaculations of wonder.—
Proh desem atque hominum fidem! was a common exclamation when
anything very marvellous occurred.

32. Quanto (clamore), dxc. “As loudly as the voice-giving sportula
gets F aesidius cheered while pleading.” A hit at the wretched orators
of the day, who used to bribe their clients and others to applaud them
while pleading or speaking in the forum. Their applause was given by
shouts of ωερε] praeclczre! bene! belle! recte! pulchre! σοφῶς] Poets,
as well as orator-s, adopted this practice of b1·ibing.—Comp. Hor. Epist.
l. 19. 37. “ non 090 ventosoe plebis szgffrayia venor Impensis caenasrum
et tritoe munere vestis ,· or, sportula may be taken sor clientes, the abstraet
for the concrete, “loud as his clamorous clients laud Faesidius when
pleading l'’—A9entem, scil. causas.

33. Bulla diynissime (Calvina, scil.) “ most deserving of the bull‹z‚’'
i. e. who ought to be accounted a mere boy, from your puerile simpli·
city and inexperience, νήπιος γέρων. The word bulla properly denoted
