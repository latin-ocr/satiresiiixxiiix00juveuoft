have beheld Ocean’s monstrous productions, and the youthful mer-men
who tenant the deep.” Ironical.—This sentence is attended with some
difficulty3 there can be no doubt, however, of our method of construc-
tion being preferable to others which we have seen. The commentators
in general tell us that folle here means “ a purse,’' and so does alutaei,
but if so, tenso folle and tumida alutd would be an insupportable tauto-
logy. We have elsewhere informed the reader of the proper meaning
’ of sollis, and by adopting it in the passage before us, (making tumida
alum explanatory of it), and by considering que as an instance of
epexegesis, we consider the sentence much relieved of its frigidity.
Further, we make vidisse depend on superbus, as there is considera-
ble harshness in the construction adopted by others; pretium est 151·
possis, (pretium) que (est) vidisse ; or, ut possis reverti, (possis) que
vidisse. In the latter case strict Latinity would require ut potueris, or
potuisses videre. Some think that tumida aluta mean's the person's
own skin inflated, as it were, with pride; but they have no authority
for giving aluta this signification. The word denotes properly “ tanned
leather‚’' and is deduced from alimen, ‘¹ alum,’' which was used in its
preparation. Ruperti’s paraphrase is wide, but as far as we ean see,
it appears to favour our method. His words are “folle tenso et aluta
tumida, βαλαντίφ, sacco argenti pleno, nummis, distento et turgente„
