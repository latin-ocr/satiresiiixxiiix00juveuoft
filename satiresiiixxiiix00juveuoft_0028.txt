XX ΟΝ ROMAN SATIRE.

The satiric rables of the Greeks, particularly of the comic poets, it is . ¹.
certain, had some affinity to the Roman satire, but the Silli had
greater-3 however, the matter and form of the satiric fable were unlike
the Roman* compositions referred to. The Silli were didactic poems,

vices of mankind were ridiculed aud censured3 but at one time it assumed an
epic, at another a lyric, at another a dramatic and didactic dress, and its raillery
wgs always di2r3e⁶ted against specified individuals, and not against vice in the
a straet ’” . .

“ Evei'i gi'anting that the name be taken from the Greeks, yet all agree that
the latter never employed it to designate any kind of poem, of the satiric class
especially, therefore the use to which the Romans transferred it was entirely
original in their case ;” p. 24. “ The Greeks did not use any word derived from
the Satyrs to signify such carping at men and manners, and such cutting irony;
bnt to desig-ntae this they used the terms σκώπτειν, διασῦςεη, κωμᾷὒω, ἰαμβίζειν.
ἰφυβςίξειη while σατυςίξειν meant to act with froward wantonness‚'' and not to
ridicule. The word παίζω which is properly applied to the Satyrs, alludesto their
wauton dancing rather than to raillery against others. The Satyrs indeed were
lustful‚ bold and saltatory; but 1 do not recollect to have read anywhere among
the Greek authors, that the Satyrs assailed permns with taunts or ridicule, at least
not as far as the period in which the satiric drama flourished, nor do 1 think that
that custom prevailed in the representation of that drama on the stage ;'' p. 25.
- '⁴‘ The name satire properly belonged to the compositions of Ennius, and Pacu-
vius, in which it was first exhibited‚ but not to the single poems of Horace, Per—
sius, and Juvenal. For Ennius and Pacuvius called their entire books satires, as
appears from the terms used by Aulus Gellius in speaking of the works of Varro
who imitated those poets. Perhaps Lucilius also termed his books satires, and not
single or isolated portions of those books. In the progress of time it is probable that
the word lost its primitive signification, and was transferred to the Lucilian style
of composition. Cruquius tells us that in the most ancient MSS. Horace's satires
are called Eclogae, which in my mind is conclusive proof that Horace himself did
not call his sinylc poenis satires. It appears from Sat. 1. 4, 73, that his single
pieces were sent first to friends, and read to very few, so that subsequently either
the author himself or some admirer of his works (tathei-,the grammarians,) collected
the fugitive writings, and arranged them into books, giving them the title Eclogie.
Among them there are pieces to which the name satire is by no means suit-
able, whether we consider it as employed in its old or new meaning3 but perhaps
Horace allowed those nondescripts, which could not be arranged under a definite
class of compositions, to be included under the term satire, notwithstanding the
manifest unsuitability of the tenn. In 1118 same way it cannot be proved that
the titles Sermones and Epistolae were given by Horace, though he may ham
given rise to such an iden. by Sat. l. 4, 39. seqq. Epist. l. 4, 1—2. l, 2503 (he
calls the satires libelli in Epist. l. 13, ⁴.) But Sidonius Apollinaris [Β. Α. D.
430] proves that these titles aro ancient. Tho grammariaus also use them in
quoting Horace. wo do not know for certain what 1101110 Persius gave either
to his books or individua] oems. Pithzeus nsserts that in some old MS. he
found these words “Thebaid‘orum Persii Satyra,'' and at the conclusion ‘⁶ Ex—
plicuit Theb. P. Satyra F eliciter.'' The gramninrians always spe-ak of 1118
““ books” in J mendic—But because nomeu, Juvenal, 01111 Persius, imitated Lu-
