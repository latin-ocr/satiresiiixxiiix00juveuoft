NOTES ΟΝ SATIRE ΙΙΙ.

ARGUMENT. [FROM DR Srocmzn]

 

Ummcms, an eminent soothsayer, disgusted at the prevalenoe of vice,
and the total disregard of needy and unassuming virtue, is introduced
as on the point of quitting Rome, 1-9, Juvenal accompanies him a
short distance out of the town, 10—20. When the honest exile, no
longer able to suppress his indignation, stops short, and in a strain oi
animated invective acquaintslhis friend with the cause of his retire-
ment, 21 seqq.

UmbrIcius' discourse may be resolved under the following heads :--
Flattery and Jjoe are the only thriving arts at Rome; 21—57. Ιιι
these points the Romans are left far 'm the distance by foreioners, more
especially the Gffieks, who resort to the city in such ‘fflffiffl-ma
Poor clients are not only defrauded of their dues by wealthy competi-
tors‚ 126—130 ; but have the mortification to see low-born fellows put
over their head. 131-136, 153 seqq. and of finding themselves univer-
sally slighted, 137—163.

Then the expense of living in Rome is enormous, 147, seqq. 164,
seqq. 223—225. Besides you are in constant apprehension of being
either buried by some over-grown, top-heavy building, or burnt in your
bed! 190—222; that is, if you can contrive to fall asleep in the midst
of such a din and racket, 232—238. Unless you are rich, you cannot
move about town with any comfort, and if you stir out after dark, you
are almost sure of a broken head, either from some missile out of a.
garret window, 268-277, or from the cudgel of some choice spirit
who has sallied into the streets in quest of an adventure, 278—301.
Should you try to avoid such a rencounter by striking into the lanes,
you run the risk of being robbed and murdered by one of those numerous
ruffians, who, for the accommodation of the honest citizens, have been
hunted into Rome, and there left to exercise their vocation unshackled,
as the blacksmiths cannot keep pace with the demand for irons, 302—

1—3. “ Although [I am] troubled at the departure of an old friend,
yet I commend his resolution of establishing his residence in eompara-
tively deserted Cumae, and of conferring at least one citizen on the
Sibyl.'' Confusus, συγχυθείς. Veteris emphatic, as the loss of an old
friend must be deeply felt.—The object of laudo is not eum understood.
