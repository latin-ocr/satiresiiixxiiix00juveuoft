that when he marries he will murder his wife for her dowry.-Efferri‚
‘'to be carried out for burial,'' is equivalent to the Greek ἰκφέςεσθωι.
—Limina subit. This phrase has reference to the custom of the
paranymphs carrying the bride across the threshold of her husband’s
dwelling, immediately after the performance of the marriage ceremony;
it being deemed unlucky to touch the threshold.

221. Quibus, dxc. “ By fingers how accursed will she be strangled in
her sleep.'’

222. Nam quoe, (bc. By a much shorter way (scil. by murdering his
wife) will your son attain ‘⁴ those riches which you think must. be gained
by journeying over land and main.”—Brevior via, ὶσητομωτίρω ὅδὸς.

224. Nullus enim, dcc. “ For no trouble attends the perpetration of
this heinous crime.’' It is easier to commit the murder, than to go
over land and sea in pursuit of wealth.

226. fisemis causa, (ize. The poet's reply to the father: well, granting
that you did not tell him specifically to do such and such crimes, “ yet
the cause and the origin of his mind being thus depraved rests with
you,’' because you always advised him to acquire riches by every pos-
sible means.

227. Nam quisquis, ἁο. “ For whoever is wont to inculcate a strong
desire for extensive wealth, that man, by his sinister advice, at the-
same time inculcates avarice in his son; and he who gives free scope to
his sons to double their inheritance by acts of injustice‚ lets out at the
same time all the reins to the steed, which should you strive to pull in,
it cannot stop, and in despite of you, leaving too the goal behind, it is
whirled along.”—line 229 is not found in many copies, and would be
better left out. It is objectionable on account of the eonjunction et,
which, if the line be retained, must receive a different meaning in 228,
229, and 230. Is, however, 229 be omitted, the πρὸησις will be 227
and 228, and the ἀπόδοσις will commence with dat libertatem‚—230. A
metaphor from the racc-course. The man who imbues his sons with
avarice is like a chariotcer who gives his steeds too much the mins, so
that they run away, and when he wishes them to turn the goal they are
beyond his restraint. Thus when a youth is tutorcd by his parent in
villany, he soon rushes recklessly into every crime, and his father's
exertions are quite unavailing to check him in his mad cumen—231.
Curriculo, curriculum is a diminutive of currus, and is here taken in
the sense of equo, as currus in Yirg. AEn. 12. ssa—Quem refers to
equo which is implied in curricula—232. Meris relictis, i. e. passiny
the goal, and rushing on instead of turning] it.

233. Nemo, (ke. ¹· No one is satisfied to act wrongly only so sar as
you allow of ; therefore they indulge themselves (i. e. they gratify their
vicious propcnsities) to a wider extent,’' scil. than you would permit or
sanction. Sons, not satisfied with the limits assigned them by their
fathers, overstcp them without hesitation.

235. Cum dicis, «ke. When you tell your son that he who does a
charimble and genet-ons act to a friend is a sool, you destroy all
humane aud noble impulsos in his bosom, and teach him, indirectly at
least, to plunder others—Stultum qui done! arnico. This does not
mean, as some think. “that he (the son) is a sool sor gyt'vn‘nq donatione
to a friend ;'' but it is the obliqua oratio, and inculcates n general
principle, scil. ¹¹ that the man who gives donations,” «ko.

230. Paupertatem. &oq ¹¹ lightens nnd alleviates the pocuniary diffi-
culties osa relative.’' This phraseology is figurative. being taken from
the notion os a bun-den.
