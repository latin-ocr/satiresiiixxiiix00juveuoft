merely denotes the place next the performers, where the most respecta-
ble of the rural audience sah—Similes has habitu implied.—Populum.
This word is here to be taken inffthe sense of plebem. In strictness it
denotes ‘⁴ that part of the population of a state which is fit for serviee” in
war, dvc. and is derived from pubes, qu. pubulus. As distinguished from
its synonyms it means “ the people,⁷' including all individuals as living to-
gether and moving in one body, without respect to their origin or civil con-
stitution. Natio or qens is the people so far as a common origin connects
the individuals ; qens is the more general term, the yreat body, to which
the nationes belonged as a subdivision : There is a difference also be-
tween plebs and vulqus.- the former is used in a political sense; the
latter in a moral sense, and with a mixture of contempt. Multitudo
“ the commonalty‚'' ‘⁵ great crowd,'’ in opposition to the nobles. In the
early period of Rome, the word Populus especially denotes the Patri-
ciaus or Bzcryhers, as opposed to the subject class plebs (πλῆθος) which
was formed of various nations (σύγκλιδις) but, chiefly οἰ eonquered
Latins.

179. Sufficiunt, dxc. “For the highest individuals [in the country-
towns]‚ the AEdiles, white tunics suffice as a dress of distinctive dignity,'’
i. e. the AEdiles, who in some municipal towns were the most consequen-
tial persons thei-ein, were content to wear the tunic, which was common
to all classes, and the only distinction observable was that the AEdiles
wore one of a brighter white than others.

180. Hie “ At Rome.”—- Ultra vires [est] “ exceeds people's means.'’
Horace's phrase is snpra vires—Hic aliquid plus Quam satis est, dte.
“ Here extravagant finery is sometimes procui-ed out of another's eoffers.''
After aliquid understand habitas, lit. ‘⁶ something of dress more than
is sufficient,” i. e. extravagant dress—Aliquid is always a substantive,
and hence it takes a genitive, (as aliquid monstri, aliquid boni, dte.) :
aliquod is always an adjective, as aliquod nomen, ἁο. The distinction
between aliquis and quidam is that the former implies supposition, the
latter reality. Thus if we say quidam scripsit, we mean definitely
that some one has written, though we know not. who, or do not choose
to mention him; but if we say aliquis scripsit, we mean some one or
other, we do not even know with certainty whether the case has hap-
pened.—-Interdmn, dxc. this clause may mean either that the money
was borrowed for the dress, or that tho dress itself was hired from an·
other's clothes-chest.

182. Ambitiosa Paupertate, “ in proud,’' or “ conceited poverty,”
scil. when a person though poor wishes to be considered rich, and spends
more money than his circumstances admit of. Paupertas, us we have
said above, does not denoto so great poverty as pauperies.

Cossus, in order to obtain admittam-0 to his morning lovee? Cossus was
a sui-namo given to the grcns Cornelia. We. may suppose him to be some
wealthy nohluman.—-Aliquando, ¹· as sometimes.” This word differs
from quondam. in the same manner as aliquis from quidam (see noto
on 180) : quondam means “ at a certain time.'' but does not defluo at
what time ; aliqnando. ⁴· once.'' only in a supposed case, which is not.

a nod] but without opening his lips to speak.'' Compare Lucian. Nigr-in.
