“ the golden hour.’'- Ganyen. The river Ganges is the largest in In-
dia. It is called in the language of Hindostan‚ Padda, also Burra
Gonga, “the Great River,'’ or Gonqa, “the river‚’' by way of emi-
nence ; and hence the European name of the river is derived. Padda
(the Sanscrit name), signifies “foot.” because the Btahmins in their
fabulous legends make the river to fiow from the foot of Βεεσήαη, who
is the same with Visclmou, or the preserving deity. This great stream
has its rise in the vast mountains of Thibet. Its source has been
found to issue in a small stream, under the name of Bhagirathi, from
under a mass of perpetual snow, accumulated on the southern side of
the Himmalaiah mountains. In the British courts of justice in India,
the water of the Ganges is used for swearing Hindoos‚ as the Koran
is for the Mahometans‚ and the yospel for Christians. The length of
the river is 1500 miles.

3. Vera bona, dac. The multam diversa to vera bona are imayinary
blessings.

4. Nebula, so ἀχλύς also is used, and we meet in the same meaning
nubes, nubila, tenebrae, caliyo mentis, ‹sm—Quid enim, dte. ‘⁶ For what, -
with good reason, are we to sear [as an evil], or desire [as a good]3”

5. Quid tam dextro, dte. ‘⁴ What wish do you form on such good
grounds, that,” dxc. lit. “ on so propitious a footing ;” quid concipis is
quid (voti) concipis ; but who, says Ruperti, ever said de.rtro pede con-
cipere votum ,2 although the phrases, dextro ct sinistro pede ire, prosi-
cisci, venire, dm„ are correct.—Di9noscere, διαγιγνώσκειν- The line cer-
tainly is faulty.

7. Evertere, dvc. “ The gods have overthrown entire families‚ by
yielding to the wishes of the very persons who composed them ;'’ as in
the case of Neptune, who granted the fulfilment of Theseus’ vows con-
cerning Hippolytus. For optantibus, some editions erroneously have
operantibus, i. e. “ sacrificing,’' scil. ipsis.

8. Faciles: this word is applied properly to wax and potter's clay,
which can be moulded with ease into any shape ; hence it is figuratively
applied to a deity or to a person who can be easily prevailed on to do
anything, εὐκίνητος, “ compliant,'’ “ indulging‚'' “ yielding ;” hence diffi-
ciles, to which 1t is opposed, means ⁴¹ inflexihle,'’ ‘⁴ inexorable,” ἅργαλῐος,
δύσκολος, χαλεπὸς. δυσχερής· The old scholiast thinks that the gods are
here termed faciles satirically, as being easily induced to inflict calami-
ties, or because they listen to soolish wasers—Noc&ura. dvc. “ In
time of peace, in time of war, things are prayed for. which are pregnant
with future injury.'' Juvenal now proceeds to illustrate the truth of
this by examples. which teach us that those objects which are commonly
considered of the highest advantage, are often converted into the instru-
ments os our destruction.— Τοῃιὶ, as the ¹⁴’57‘1 was worn in time of tran-
quillity, hence it comcs to signisy “peace ;'' Comp. Livy, 3. 10. “ dum
(lomi, dum loqati sint.'' 'rho sagium which was worn in time of hostility
is also employed to denote ‘⁸ war'' itself.

9. Tor-rens divendi, «hc. ‘⁴ An impetuous llow of languagc,” ‘¹ fluency
os spce‹·h.''—Mullis,· cer. gir. Demosthenes. Cicero, (hc.

10. Facundia, (from juri) strictly refers to ‘¹ grace and sacility’' in
speaking: eloquentia, includes these. and also all the other requisites
for persuasion.-- Viribus. ‘¹ physical powers.''—-Ille. “that famous man,”
scil. Milo, an athlete of Crotona in Magna Graecia, who was celebrated
for his strength. lle was seven times crowncd at the Pythian gamen,
