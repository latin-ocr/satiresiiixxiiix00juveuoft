92. Deam-nat, ὣο. “ Let Isis decree whatever she will respecting my'
person, let her even strike my eyes with her angry sistrum,” i. e. with
her sistrum iu her wrath. The worship of Isis was introduced into
*Italy from Egypt. It was thought that this goddess inflicted blindness
upon those who were guilty of perjury. Great numbers of blind per-
sons, we are told, were, and are, to be found in Egypt; and their blind-
ness was, by the superstitious attributed to Isis, instead of their natural
causes, namely, the nitrous quality of the air, the typhons or whirlwinds
and the drifting sand.--The sistrum (σεῖστρον) was a mystical instru-
ment of music, used by the ancient Egyptians in their ceremonies,
and especially in the worship of Isis. It was held in the right hand,
and shaken, from which circumstance it derived its name (from σείει·
concutere). Its shape could not be well described without a wood-cut,
which may be seen in Smith‘s Dictionary of Greek and Roman An-
tiquities. Apuleius describes it as a bronze rattle (aereum crepitacu-
Ium)‚ consisting of a narrow plate curved like a sword-belt (balteus).
through which passed a few rods, which rendered a loud shrill sound.
He says that these instruments were sometimes made of silver, or even.
of gold. He also seems to intimate, that the shakes were three to-
gether (teryeminos ictus [rather jactusD, which would make a sort of
rude music.

94. Dummddo, (be. “ provided that, even blind, I may retaiu‚’' dte.

95. Vomicoe putres, “malignant imposthumes.'' Here we are told
of other punishments inflicted by the gods on perjurers.

96. Tanti? ‘¹ of such consequence,” that a person would not rather

iem, “ if attended by wealth‚’' or as others explain, “ which is a frequent

97. Ladas, i. e. even a man so swift of soot as Ladas was, who won
the prize in running at the Olympio games in the time of Alexander the
(Reate—Si 11011, 1110. i. e. if heis in his semes—Anticyra, Ἀντίκυρα
(properly Ἀντίκιῤῥα, i. 0. “opposite to Cirrha”), was the name os two
maritime towns, one in Phocis, on the Crissaean gulf, the other in
Phthiotis, on the Maliac gulf. Both places produced hellebore, which
was in great repnte as a cure for insanity. Horace in his satires (n.2.)
is thought to allude to three Anticyras, but this is an error, for he
speaks of a head so insane as not to be eured by the produce of three
Anticyras, even if elici-e were three, instead os two.

98. Arclzigyene, i. e. some physieian to bleed him. Archigenes was a
physician of considerable eminencc, highly commended by Galen: he
wrote some treatiscs which are now lost—Quid enim. (he. of what ad—
vantage to Ladas was it to conquer in the raee, if. notwithstanding, he
had nothing 10 eat ?—Qnid 111-1031111, “ of what avail to him is‚’' &c.

gamos were celebrated every fifth year, in an extensive plain, on the banks
of 1110 Alpheus, between Elis and Pisa. The prize was an olive ehaplet:
luit the victui—s received other gists besides, and almost divine honours.
Yet neither their honours nor prizes defended them from poverty's ap-
proach. 'l'he learner will recollect that it is tho pcrjurer who speaks
