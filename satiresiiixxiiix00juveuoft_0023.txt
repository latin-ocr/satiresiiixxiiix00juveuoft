ΟΝ ROMAN SATIRE. XV

and by Xenophanes of Lesbos in heroic, lambio, and elegiae verses.
Only a few verses of the Silli are extant. They appear to be merely
parodics, wherein philosophers of every class, and sublime expressions
of Homer are turned to ridicule.

Let us now turn our attention to Roman satire. From the loci
classici in Virg. Georg. 2. 385. and Hor. Epis. 2. 139, seqq„ it appears
that, in the primitive* ageS, festivals in honour of Bacchus were solem-
nized each year by the country people at harvest home, with almost
the same attendant circumstances as among the Greeks; that the same
kind of loose acting was performed throughout the villages ; that they
sang hymns in honour of the rural deities; that they formed little
images, or rather masks of bark (oscilla) as images of Bacchus which they
hung up on trees; that being moved to and fro by the winds, abundant
fertility might. be dispensed over the fields (by the agency of the god).
Moreover they covered their faces with these, and being thus masked
and flushed with wine, they used to utter mutual satirical invectives
in verses extemporaneous, and necessarily unpolished.

These were the Satur-nii versus (i. e. prisci ac rudes), called also
Fescennini, from Fescennia a town of Etruria. The verses were not
bound by metrical laws (ἳμμετρσι), but yet they were not totally devoid
of rhythm (i. e. they were ἵῤῥυθμοι). This species of verse was used
long and often in Rome, in festal periods aud at other solemnities, par-
ticularly at weddings and triumphs. See Hor. Epis. 2. 1, 146, where
the law alluded to is the 7th of the 12 Tables—“ Si qzci pz‘pzclo (pub-
lice vel convicio) occentasit (al. actitavisset) carmem-e condisit, quod
infamiam faxit. flagitiumve alteri, fuste ferito.'’ “The great liberty
which the writers of the F escennine verses took with the names of even
virtuous characters was the cause of the enactment of this law.'’--
Euanthius.

From the Fescennine verses the dramatic satire of the Romans
sprung, and afterwards the diductio. We are taught this by Livy in
his account of the origin of scenic entertainments in Rome (Book 7.
ch. 2). As it is important that the student should read Livy’s state-
ment, we shall be pardoned for giving a translation of the passage; the
version is Baker's. “ The pestilence continuing during both this and
the following year (i. e. A.o.c. 390 and 391), in which Caius Sulpicius
Peticus and Caius Licinius Stolo were consuls; nothing memorable
was transacted, only that, for the purpose of soliciting the favour of the
godet, the Lectisternium was performed the third time since the building
of the city (the first took place A.tJ.c. 356, and on the same account.—
Ruperti). But the disorder receiving no alleviation. either from human
wisdom or divine aid, the strength of the people’s minds became almost
overpowered by superstition, and it is said, that on this occasion, among
other devices for appeasing the wrath of heaven, scenio plays were in-
troduced ; a new thing to a warlike people, for hitherto there had been
only the shows of the circus. However, this kind of performance was,
as in general all beginnings are, but a trifiing matter, and even that
borrowed from abroad. Actors were sent for from Etruria, who, though
without any poetical language, or any gestures correspondent to such
language, yet regulating their motions by the measures of the music,
exhibited, in the Tuscan manner, something far from ungraceful. The
younger citizens soon began to imitate these ; throwing out, at the same

ἓ* The word “primitive‚'' or “most ancient‚” is important, as it contains an
allusion to the fact of the Roman satire being indi-(leneus to Italy.
