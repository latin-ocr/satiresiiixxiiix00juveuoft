i. e. Cretan. Jupiter was reared 111 Crete. Layenae were not only
“flagons'’ in which—the wine was brought into the dining—parlour‚ but

. also ‘¹ flasks” in which it was kept in their cellars.

272. Hic, “The person I mentioned‚'’ the funambulus—Ancipitz
fiqens vestiqia planta, ‘¹ slowly walking, (along the rope) with uncer-
tain foot; i. e. with perilous tread. The phrase vestiyia sign-re occurs
also in Virg. AEn. 6. 159. on which Forbiger makes the following ob-
servationt—“Vestiqia fiyere is not the same as vestiqz'a. ponere. but,
like t‘estz'yia premere, means to walk slowly, step by step, as it were,
occasionally stopping short as men are apt to do whose minds are
anxious and unsettled.’¹

that, procures merely the necessaries os life.'’-—Brumam, See 3. 102.

Talenta. Talentum (τάλαντον) meant originally “a balance,” then ·· the
substance weighed‚” and lastly, and commonly, a certain weight. the
talem. The Greek system of money, as well as the Roman, and those
of most other nadons, was founded on a reference to weight. A certain
weight of silver among the Greeks, as of copper among the Romans,
was used as a representative of a value, which was originally and gener-
ally that of the metal itself. The talent, therefore, and its divisions.
are denominations of money, as well as of weight.—The Attio talent
was &93 15³ ; and where talents are mentioned in the classical writers
without any specification of the standard, we must generally understand
the Attio. “ A thousand talents⁷’ amounts to 3193J750.

out of these words, viz.-“ There are more meu who have encountered
shipwreck, than have escaped it:'’ thus he takes in pelaqo to mean
literally “ 111 the sea,” i. e. at the bottom of the ocean. The phrase is
merely equivalent to “all the world goes to sea.’' An amplification on
the part of the poet, in describing the wide-spread infection of avarice.

277. Classis, “ crowds of vessels.’'

278. Veniet, seqq. Ships will not only go to the East, but to the
West.—C'arpacllium. The Carpathian sea was between Rhodes, Crete,
and Cyprus3 and was so called from the island of Carpathus (now
Scarpanto).—Goetzzla oequora, ‘⁶ the Lybian sea.’' Gaetulia was a
country of Africa, south of Numidia, and now answering in some

. degree to Biledulyerid, “the region of locusts.’'

1. 3. 24.-Lon9e Calpe relicta, “leaving Calpes far behind.'’—- Calpe
(Gibraltar) and Abyla 111 Africa (now Ceam) were the two pillars of
Hercules. Calpe is commonly found of the first declension‚ (yenit.
Calpes), but it is more correctly of the third.

280. The gulf of Hercules was called fretum Gaditanum—Striden-
